<@564827142345588737> how can I save them to a file?

##### David Mansolino 05/15/2020 07:21:10
The refresh rate of the default robot windows is not configurable, but you can get the data from your controller at the rate you want and save them to a file

Hi <@564827142345588737> Can I get the engine information in the data for 0.1 seconds as data?

I'll try the urdf2webots program again tomorrow

##### Troy 05/15/2020 04:54:59
but the URDF is correct, I imported this urdf into V-Rep, and it's correct

##### Troy 05/15/2020 04:54:08
I'm not sure if I could share this model

##### David Mansolino 05/15/2020 04:53:04
Hi <@!697989704536162354> it seems there is an issue with the generated PROTO, can you share it with us so that we can check what is exactly the problem?

##### Troy 05/14/2020 15:46:43
what should I do with the proto file or the URDF file?

##### Troy 05/14/2020 15:45:55
Hi! I have a problem. When I used the proto to import the robot, one of my model is correct, but when I import the other one using the same method, webots reminds me that " ERROR: 'D:/Lab/Simulation/5_13TestURDF/protos/MCrab.proto':19:39: error: Expected node or PROTO name, found '{'. " I both used the urdf2webots program to output the proto file, and put them in two separate wbt file. I don't what wrong...

Have you tried the safe mode (https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/starting-webots#on-windows )?
Or to open another world file?

##### nav3549 05/14/2020 11:29:15
I tried to delete these preferences to solve the problem, but still persists. And the preferences variables are set again after i open webots
