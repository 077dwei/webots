Let me check if I can find a stale branch, by the way what is your Github username?

### Luftwaffel 05/13/2020 15:34:08
I submitted it April 30th, any way to check all activity? perhaps I submited it to a weird branch. Not that familiar with github

### Luftwaffel 05/13/2020 15:27:46
great ðŸ˜©

### David Mansolino 05/13/2020 15:26:56
> I can't find my commit
<@!239507682111913984> me neither

### David Mansolino 05/13/2020 15:26:46
Did you fork the repo?

### Luftwaffel 05/13/2020 15:26:19
I can't find my commit

### David Mansolino 05/13/2020 15:25:07
Ok perfect, can you then open a pull-request from the branch where you did the commit so that we can review and merge it?

### Luftwaffel 05/13/2020 15:22:20
<@!564827142345588737>  I made a commit here https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots/edit/master/docs/reference/supervisor.md

### David Mansolino 05/13/2020 15:07:12
For doc correction you can target master directly

### lojik 05/13/2020 15:06:06
Do you prefer to do the pull request directly in master or in an other branch ?

### David Mansolino 05/13/2020 14:56:55
Yes exactly.

### lojik 05/13/2020 14:55:35
Thank you, I already have a github account so I will do that. The right way is to fork the repository and then purpose a pull request with my changes ?

### David Mansolino 05/13/2020 14:52:55
Hi, thank you for pointing this out, you can edit this directly on github and create a PR for merging your changes, here is the editor (you need a Github account): https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots/edit/master/docs/reference/worldinfo.md

### lojik 05/13/2020 14:51:20
Hello everyone, how can we help to document webots ? I would be happy to take part to improve it.

I think there is a mistake on the following part : https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/worldinfo on the basicTimeStep part it is written that the minimum value could be 0.001 (one microsecond), but in the table at the beginning, the variable should be [1, inf). If we put less than 1, the simulation does not start in the example accelerometer.
