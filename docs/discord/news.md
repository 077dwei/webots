Hi `@machinekoder` yes R2020a is compatible with ROS1 kinetic and melodic and ROS2 crystal, dashing and eloquent.

##### machinekoder 12/20/2019 10:41:23
`@Stefania Pedrazzi` Is RWebots 2020a also released for Ubuntu Melodic or do we have to wait for the next and last ROS classic release with Py3 support?

##### Stefania Pedrazzi [cyberbotics] 12/19/2019 09:09:25

New release of the webots\_ros package: [http://wiki.ros.org/webots\_ros](http://wiki.ros.org/webots_ros)



The webots\_ros package lets you use Webots together with ROS.



This new version of the package greatly simplifies the interface between Webots and ROS, new launch files are provided to start your node and the corresponding simulation easily. We also wrote some documentation about the available sample simulations: [http://wiki.ros.org/webots\_ros/Tutorials/Sample%20Simulations](http://wiki.ros.org/webots_ros/Tutorials/Sample%20Simulations)
