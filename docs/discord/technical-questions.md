##### shridhar 04/18/2019 07:08:31
Hello, I have included camera and a Hingejoint in  children field of Robot and wrote a controller to spin a solid cylinder but when I run the controller even the cameras are rotating. so how to rotate the solid without rotating camera ( i tried with two separate Robots but still the result is same.

##### Stefania Pedrazzi [cyberbotics] 04/18/2019 07:10:35
Hi, if you don't want to rotate  the camera, then the Camera node doesn't have to be a descendant of the HingeJoint node

##### shridhar 04/18/2019 07:13:08
ya the camera is not descendant of HingeJoint but both are children of Robot.

##### Stefania Pedrazzi [cyberbotics] 04/18/2019 07:15:02
So then if you rotate the HingeJoint, the camera doesn't move. Please check your world because if it works differently then your are not moving the correct HingeJoint or your robot node hierarchy is wrong.

##### shridhar 04/18/2019 07:17:12
ok I will check it

##### Fabien Rohrer [Moderator] 04/18/2019 08:01:15
Could you tell us your OS, Webots version and Matlab version?


Do you try to run a sample provided in Webots (which one?)? Or did you modified the controller?

##### Fabien Rohrer [Moderator] 04/18/2019 08:05:52
Did you tried with Webots R2019a.rev1?

##### Jiajun Wang 04/18/2019 08:06:14
of course

##### Fabien Rohrer [Moderator] 04/18/2019 08:08:19
Ok


On Ubuntu, you could try to remove the remoteControl library from the E-puck.proto


To do so, please try to remove the last lines of projects/robots/gctronic/e-puck/protos/E-puck.proto


%{ if v2 then }%

    remoteControl "e-puck\_wifi"

  %{ else }%

    remoteControl "e-puck\_bluetooth"

  %{ end }%


This would give us clues: is this library problematic for matlab?

##### Jiajun Wang 04/18/2019 08:12:22
AndÔºåwhat about the error in win10Ôºü

##### Fabien Rohrer [Moderator] 04/18/2019 08:13:13
it seems that at line 23 of your controller, you don't send a string.


could you check this by printing the ps\_names(i)?

##### Jiajun Wang 04/18/2019 08:16:41
okÔºåi will try later.         In win10, always show: Mathworks collapse ! and never success in simulation


even couldnot start

##### Fabien Rohrer [Moderator] 04/18/2019 08:18:50
I'm not sure why. It would deserve to be debugged. It would be extremely useful if you could determine at which point it fails precisely, and fill a bug report on our GitHub issues.

This error appear when the sound engine cannot be initialized smoothly.


Do you have issues with sound on your computer?


I think that if you "mute" the sound (from the top menu) this should disapear.

##### Fabien Rohrer [Moderator] 04/18/2019 09:48:17
Sorry, I don't have matlab right now. Couldn't you simply open the .m controller in the Matlab editor?

##### Jiajun Wang 04/18/2019 09:49:14
the matlab editor could not find : the function like : wb\_distance\_sensor\_get\_value(ps{i})

##### Fabien Rohrer [Moderator] 04/18/2019 09:52:11
I'm not expert in the Matlab GUI. I expect there is a way to open/target/link with the $WEBOTS\_HOME/lib/matlab directory!?

ok  , thank you a lot

##### Fabien Rohrer [Moderator] 04/18/2019 09:53:49

##### Fabien Rohrer [Moderator] 04/18/2019 13:31:33
hi


you refer a Display node. Do you want to store the result of a Display node?

##### shridhar 04/18/2019 13:32:35
yes


either captured or displayed ..

##### Fabien Rohrer [Moderator] 04/18/2019 13:34:17
There is no way to access the Display texture data directly, but you could use the wb\_display\_image\_save() function ([https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/display#wb\_display\_image\_save](https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/display#wb_display_image_save)) and open it in opencv

##### shridhar 04/18/2019 13:35:08

##### Fabien Rohrer [Moderator] 04/18/2019 13:35:40
I can easily provide you these examples:


[https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/samples-howto#vision-wbt](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/samples-howto#vision-wbt)


I recommend you to read the OpenCV doc to understand how to load an image. This is a basic task.

##### shridhar 04/18/2019 13:37:47
Thank you.. sorry for the simple question ..

##### Fabien Rohrer [Moderator] 04/18/2019 13:39:09
I think it would deserve to post this kind of general question (quite out of focus of a direct use of Webots), on stackoverflow with the Webots tag. We monitor these questions and answer them if we think it's interesting for the community:


[https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/webots](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/webots)

##### Thelm76 04/18/2019 14:08:13
Hi, i'm trying to implement the missing sensors of the E-PUCK in the webots' simulation,

I am actually working on adding the ToF sensor of th V2 version by editing the prototype file but it returns an error:



    %{ if v2 then }%

      DEF EPUCK\_TOF E-puckDistanceSensor {

        translation 0 0.033 -0.035

        rotation 0 1 0 1.57

        name "ToF"

        lookupTable [

          0 0 0 4 4 0

        ]

      }

    %{ end }%







ERROR: 'S:/GDrive/Traineeship/prog/Webots/e-puck/maze/protos/E-puck.proto':367:7: error: Skipped unknown 'lookupTable' parameter in E-puckDistanceSensor PROTO.

##### Fabien Rohrer [Moderator] 04/18/2019 14:10:50
Quite difficult to understand: the E-puckDistance sensor is a PROTO (i.e. a fa√ßade) of a DistanceSensor node.


Its definition is there: projects/robots/gctronic/e-puck/protos/E-puckDistanceSensor.proto


[https://github.com/omichel/webots/blob/master/projects/robots/gctronic/e-puck/protos/E-puckDistanceSensor.proto#L1](https://github.com/omichel/webots/blob/master/projects/robots/gctronic/e-puck/protos/E-puckDistanceSensor.proto#L1)


the lookupTable is not an open field.

##### Thelm76 04/18/2019 14:12:03
Actually I've just copied one of the other distance sensors and tried to modify it in order to have a different range


oh


I think I've found my error

##### Fabien Rohrer [Moderator] 04/18/2019 14:12:44
You could open the lookupTable by adding a line in the  E-puckDistanceSensor.proto file:

##### Thelm76 04/18/2019 14:12:56
I have left e-puckDistanceSensor instead of just  DistanceSensor that's right?

##### Fabien Rohrer [Moderator] 04/18/2019 14:13:17
Yes, that's another approach.


You could directly use DistanceSensor there

##### Thelm76 04/18/2019 14:13:58
but will the sensors added in the proto file be working with a real e-puck?

##### Fabien Rohrer [Moderator] 04/18/2019 14:14:15
Unfortunately no.

##### Thelm76 04/18/2019 14:14:29
oh...

##### Fabien Rohrer [Moderator] 04/18/2019 14:14:35
If you do that, you only act on the simulated robot.


(which is the first step in any case)

##### Thelm76 04/18/2019 14:15:14
in fact, I am trying to add a support of the sensors like the gyro, the magnetometer and the ToF sensor in webots...

##### Fabien Rohrer [Moderator] 04/18/2019 14:15:53
This is a good development üëç


Once added in the E-puck PROTO, you should also add the devices to the communication protocol between the e-puck controller and the real e-puck

##### Thelm76 04/18/2019 14:16:54
and as I'm beggining with webots, I don't really know which file defines the sensors in the real e-puck

##### Fabien Rohrer [Moderator] 04/18/2019 14:16:55
You simply have to add this into the e-puck\_wifi library... somewhere üòÉ


You should take a look at this directory: [https://github.com/omichel/webots/tree/master/projects/robots/gctronic/e-puck/plugins/remote\_controls/e-puck\_wifi](https://github.com/omichel/webots/tree/master/projects/robots/gctronic/e-puck/plugins/remote_controls/e-puck_wifi)

##### Thelm76 04/18/2019 14:18:03
If I successfully add these sensors I could send you the files if you want

##### Fabien Rohrer [Moderator] 04/18/2019 14:18:34
It would be awesome if you could create a GitHub Pull Request for this.


We could communicate there and help you to achieve.


To do so, just fork the webots repo, create a branch containing your patch, and you should be able to create the pull request.


For example, here is a pull request a user had submited recently:

##### Lukas\_ 04/19/2019 13:47:30
Hello, I have question. In webots  -> generic robot window -> GPS i can see graph with all values during run. Can I somehow export all those data to external file? I am using C code and have printf for value at given time (step()) but what if i want to access all data as they are in the graph. Can i do it and if so, how?

##### Fabien Rohrer [Moderator] 04/19/2019 16:39:24
Instead of printf, you could use fprintf to write those values in a file. This file could then be imported in your favorite plotter (pyplot, Matlab, excel, harryplotter, etc. )

##### Lukas\_ 04/19/2019 16:42:58
well yes but printf fprintf only give me value in current time or after current step() but what if in the end of simulation i want to have all sensor data with TIME\_STEP. Am i missing something? Is this what i ask for possible?

##### Fabien Rohrer [Moderator] 04/19/2019 16:56:10
fprintf allows you to append data to an existing file, therefore to store the history. For example, you could create the file at the begining of the simulation (fprintf(..., ‚Äúw‚Äù)) and then append to this file a line containing the data and the time per step (fprintf(f, ‚Äú%g, %g, %g, %g\n‚Äú, time, v0, v1, v2))

##### Lukas\_ 04/19/2019 17:04:39
Yes i understand that but what you suggest is excatly what i dont want, save data at given time. The graph thats is made durring simulation i would like those data used in it. How can i access all of them? Not only data that i can save only at time but like in the graph data from time when sensor is enabled until the end of simulation.  They should be stored somewhere since i can change between time, xy, xz and yz. But how i can access them?

##### el 04/19/2019 17:33:41
libobencv\_imgprog401.dll not found , do you know maybe how can i solve it easily?

##### Fabien Rohrer [Moderator] 04/19/2019 18:38:42
`@Lukas_` the source code of the generic robot window is in this directory: [https://github.com/omichel/webots/tree/master/resources/projects/plugins/robot\_windows/generic](https://github.com/omichel/webots/tree/master/resources/projects/plugins/robot_windows/generic)


`@el` OpenCv is supposed to be installed from pacman here: [https://github.com/omichel/webots/blob/master/src/install\_scripts/msys64\_installer.sh#L28](https://github.com/omichel/webots/blob/master/src/install_scripts/msys64_installer.sh#L28)


But it seems to be not released: [https://github.com/omichel/webots/blob/master/src/packaging/files\_msys64.txt](https://github.com/omichel/webots/blob/master/src/packaging/files_msys64.txt)


We will create a fix soon


Meanwhile you could solve this by installing Webots from sources


[https://github.com/omichel/webots/wiki/Windows-installation](https://github.com/omichel/webots/wiki/Windows-installation)

##### Lukas\_ 04/19/2019 18:49:33
Wait, so i have to save data there? Basically i have to change webots simulation file on my PC?

##### Fabien Rohrer [Moderator] 04/19/2019 18:50:50
To be honest I still don‚Äôt understand why you cannot store the data from the controller üòÖ

##### Lukas\_ 04/19/2019 18:53:24
Well i want to have data with static time period difrence between each one and in code i have move comand then i wait, then end, after that different command with different wait, pause, sleep  so i am unable to have this period in between.


The sensor reads data at any given moment right? So is there any easy way to access this container, bulk, field of datas?

##### Fabien Rohrer [Moderator] 04/19/2019 19:00:14
The controller is by definition at a fixed time between to steps. You can get the simulated time there.


When the sensor API is used, it gives you the sensor feedback of the last discrete simulation step.

##### Lukas\_ 04/19/2019 19:07:49
But i would like to get values of every step. Like in matlab where you get all values after simulation and can plot them. This is what i need. Is it possible from controller?

##### Fabien Rohrer [Moderator] 04/19/2019 19:10:39
Yes sure. The Matlab sample is a controller, and the generic robot window uses the controller API only üòâ

##### Lukas\_ 04/19/2019 19:12:18
So i must change the source of generic robot window to save all sensor data?

##### Fabien Rohrer [Moderator] 04/19/2019 19:12:41
You should document yourself on the way time is managed in Webots.


Not necessarily. It‚Äôs a bad idea IMO, because everything is directly accessible from the controller API.

##### Lukas\_ 04/19/2019 19:14:04
To be honest now i am lost üòÖ

##### Fabien Rohrer [Moderator] 04/19/2019 19:17:13
Haha sorry for this


If you create a simple controller, and write a line between each wb\_robot\_step call, this ensures you cannot miss any data.


This ensures you that you will have one data every 32 simulated milliseconds. (If WorldInfo.basicTimeStep = 32)


So this is perfect to plot a graph with a regular x-axis (time)


This is what we do in the generic window.


Sounds better like this?

##### Lukas\_ 04/19/2019 19:22:50
yes thank you


would it be problem if i use this function as a sleep?

static void passive\_wait(double sec) {

  double start\_time = wb\_robot\_get\_time();

  do {

    step();

  } while (start\_time + sec > wb\_robot\_get\_time());

}


i should change to something like that 

static void passive\_wait(double sec) {

  double start\_time = wb\_robot\_get\_time();

  do {

    step();

fprinft(mydata)

  } while (start\_time + sec > wb\_robot\_get\_time());

}

RIGHT?

##### Fabien Rohrer [Moderator] 04/19/2019 19:26:55
Both are possible.


If you choose solution 1. You should store also the simulated time when you acquire the data.


If you choose solution 2. you know that the time between two values are taken is constant.


It‚Äôs just something to take into account when you plot the data.

##### Lukas\_ 04/19/2019 19:30:50
So solution 2 it is for me thank, this was help full. I did not fully understood it before now now i know what i need to do. üëå  great job, thanks

Hi,

I installed Webots 8. In the dialogue window I type my e-mail address and password and then I get confirmation that my floating license exists but as soon as I confirme it I get a message saying I have no license rights.  How can i get the 30 days  trial licenece?

Thanks in advance,

##### Fabien Rohrer [Moderator] 04/20/2019 10:37:35
`@wail_maghdoud` webots 8 is obsolete (proprietary and closed source), please use R2019.rev1 (free and open-source, same features)


`@ina` indeed, controllers only deal with stdout and stderr, but not stdin. Please use another IPC


About VS, normally you should be able to attach the controller process from the VS interface when its running (at simulation step 1)


But to be honest I didn‚Äôt tried this since a while üòÖ

I wonder if webots can simulate planar robots? `@Fabien Rohrer`


That is to say, how to set the planar constraints between robot body with the background/space? thx`@Fabien Rohrer`

##### Akash 04/21/2019 11:59:11
Is there any  kind of ray ( 'DistanceSensor' or 'Emitter')   that can be reflected back to the 'Receiver' (Infra red)' from a 'boundingObject' ?

##### Fabien Rohrer [Moderator] 04/21/2019 14:28:55
`@el` indeed. The qt version seems problematic. Probably because of an update of pacman. Could you open a Github issue with this?


`@ina` yes GDb works, please refer to [https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/debugging-c-cpp-controllers](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/debugging-c-cpp-controllers)


`@Lukas_` please refer to wb\_robot\_get\_time() [https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/robot?tab=c++#wb\_robot\_get\_time](https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/robot?tab=c++#wb_robot_get_time)


It returns the simulated time as a double in seconds.


`@Jiajun Wang` not sure what you mean by a ¬´¬†planar robot¬†¬ª. A 2 wheeled robots on a planar ground?


`@Akash` distance sensors uses rays but do not ensure communication


Emitter/receiver can deal with occlusions. It‚Äôs more what you need. But not with reflexion.

##### Jiajun Wang 04/21/2019 15:31:20
`@Fabien Rohrer`

 A planar robot means that the robot\_body's DOF in y, roll & yaw are fixed. such that the robot can only move in the saggittal plane.  

like the Raibert's robot: hopper.


`@Fabien Rohrer`

 I mean a 2D bipedal robot.

##### Fabien Rohrer [Moderator] 04/21/2019 18:22:28
Ok I see. Basically Webots can simulate any robot which is made of a set of solids linked with joints (passive or motorized). To know how to do that, refer to our user guide tutorials. Once done, you could create a controller having access to the dynamics through the sensor API (gyro, inertial unit, etc)


So a hopper leg could be modeled as a sequence of rotational/linear motors.

##### redbagy 04/22/2019 08:42:50
Is there a way to know the time steps taken to execute a command?


like wb\_emitter\_send()


or can I assume that each action takes one time step for example?

##### Fabien Rohrer [Moderator] 04/22/2019 10:52:49
The simulated time is freezed in between two wb\_robot\_step() calls. Its these calls which let the simulation steps forward of a discrete amount of time.

##### redbagy 04/22/2019 10:54:01
Oh ok thank you!

Hello,dear developers. I am controlling  a motor using :  motor[2]->setPosition(std::numeric\_limits<double>::infinity());

  motor[2]->setVelocity(0.2); but the motor moveing is not very smooth. I can clearly the velocity fluctuating. Is that correct?

##### Fabien Rohrer [Moderator] 04/24/2019 07:48:32
Hi


Yes this is the right way.


But it is affected by other parameters.


Principally, has the motor enough torque (force) to lift its weight?


To be sure of this, you could for example increase the RotationalMotor.maxTorque field: [https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/rotationalmotor](https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/rotationalmotor)

##### Âè§‰∫Ü‰∏™Èπè 04/24/2019 07:50:41
I think it has enough torque. I set the torque into 100


Even I set it into 1000, it still cannot move smoothly~

##### Fabien Rohrer [Moderator] 04/24/2019 07:54:13
Could you just try to set it to 1000000 to be sure üòâ ?


(just the time to understand if it's the issue)

##### Âè§‰∫Ü‰∏™Èπè 04/24/2019 07:55:58

##### Âè§‰∫Ü‰∏™Èπè 04/24/2019 07:59:17
but in the simulation window, it moves step by stepüòÇ


Maybe it works in the right way.

##### Fabien Rohrer [Moderator] 04/24/2019 08:01:55
A movie is recording in real-time. In the 3D window, the time may fluctuate if some bottleneck is reached or if the computer is somehow saturated.

Ok. Thanks~üëå

##### Fabien Rohrer [Moderator] 04/24/2019 08:06:05
Do you use the "real-time" button? Could you check that your WorldInfo is set to something reasonable (like 8 or 16 for such robot)? You could also decrease OpenGL preferences, etc. => It's much more convenient to work in real-time and do in order that this is reached (speedometer is constantly reaching 1.0x without fluctuations)

##### Âè§‰∫Ü‰∏™Èπè 04/24/2019 08:49:27
Yes, I use the real-time button. And the bacistimestep is 8.


The realtime speed, the simulation ratio is about 0.90 to 0.98x


I open some other example project. they can moves in very smoothly.


So I think there are something I do not set it up right


I meet this error: WARNING: Robot > DEF RFJoint HingeJoint > Solid > HingeJoint > RotationalMotor: too low requested position: -1 < 0


when I use c++ api setPosition


motor[1] ->setPosition(-1.0);


If I set it in a positive value, it works right.


How can I solve it?

##### Fabien Rohrer [Moderator] 04/24/2019 14:19:11
You control the motor in velocity mode, don't you?

##### Âè§‰∫Ü‰∏™Èπè 04/24/2019 14:20:12
No, I don't define the working mode.

and the default minposition is 0.

##### Fabien Rohrer [Moderator] 04/24/2019 14:24:07
Ok, that's the issue. You defined the range from 0 to 100, and try to set a value of -1 üòÉ


just change minPosition to -100 or so..

##### Âè§‰∫Ü‰∏™Èπè 04/24/2019 14:30:04
And how can I make the simulation speed is the same as I planned? I planned 10001 datas in 10s. But when I read the planned data and setPosition into the motor. the simulation time is not the same as I planned.

##### Fabien Rohrer [Moderator] 04/24/2019 14:32:15
You should apply 1000 steps per second, so you should set WorldInfo.basicTimeStep to 1 (milliseconds). This should work precisely. To be sure, you can get the simulated time in your controller using the wb\_robot\_get\_time() function.


.. and your controller should call steps of 1 ms too: wb\_robot\_step(1)

##### Âè§‰∫Ü‰∏™Èπè 04/24/2019 14:36:06
I write the controller into C++. Is there still the wb\_robot\_steo() like C?

##### Fabien Rohrer [Moderator] 04/24/2019 14:36:30
Yes, it's Robot.step(1) (it's the same function)

üëå

##### Fabien Rohrer [Moderator] 04/24/2019 14:38:14
It's generally a good idea to let match the controller step rate with WorldInfo.basicTimeStep. In most of my controllers, I'm using this pattern:


Robot.step((int) Robot.getBasicTimeStep())

Hello people! Does anybody know how run multiple robots or webots instances in parallel to speed to the learning process (for a reinforcement learning algorithm)?  What is the best way to do that in your experience?


I found this old thread, but they were talking about the PRO version (which doesn't exist anymore in my knowledge)


[https://www.cyberbotics.com/forum?message=5060](https://www.cyberbotics.com/forum?message=5060)

##### Fabien Rohrer [Moderator] 04/25/2019 13:53:58
Hi


Indeed, Webots PRO license doesn't exist anymore, Webots is now free and open-source: this is a good news to run as many Webots instances as you can üòâ


I like the idea to have a script using Webots as a slave and running one Webots instance per experiment.


This is on the responsability of this script to create deal with parallelism.


This many advantages, this is very easy to setup.


The main drawback is that launching Webots takes time; this offset may be annoying.

##### El\_Samu\_El 04/25/2019 13:57:58
I like that idea too, it is just not clear to me how the CPU ressources  are used in this way. And because there would be around 6-12 instances in parallel opening and closing webots GUIs every second.


Yes this offset is what I am worried about.


A single experiment runs in let's say  0.1s in fast forward mode.

##### Fabien Rohrer [Moderator] 04/25/2019 13:59:29
The CPU/GPU consumption depends a lot on the simulation.


Before fearing the offset to run Webots, you could give a try to optimize your simulation üòâ


A simple test running a simulation sample on multiple instances may give you answers about your CPU load.


To avoid the offset, there is another approach:


to run several Webots slaves "forever", and the main script communicate with them (using any IPC). Webots Supervisor API allows to load another world, reload a world, etc.


A bit more difficult to setup, but it's more efficient in your case.


I hope this will help you.

##### El\_Samu\_El 04/25/2019 14:13:00
Yeah It does, thanks! But how can the main script reload the world and read data from the supervisor controller? I have no experience setting up IPCs. I'll see if anybody else did something similar before, otherwise I'll try to figure out how to do that. Any tips are welcomes üòÉ

##### Fabien Rohrer [Moderator] 04/25/2019 14:14:13
A simple approach is the following:


... hum just a question: do you need to change the world, or it's just a matter of training a controller in the same world?

##### El\_Samu\_El 04/25/2019 14:16:49
later on I will change the world, but for the most iterations it is the same world


it is about locomotion learning

##### Fabien Rohrer [Moderator] 04/25/2019 14:18:03
and in which language? Python?

##### El\_Samu\_El 04/25/2019 14:18:49
Python yes. There will be a curriculum in which the terrain on which the robot walk becomes more challenging.


But on a single terrain (world) the learner needs around 1000-5000 iterations.


one iteration corresponds to walking until it falls, which is in real time from around 0.5 to 5 seconds

##### Fabien Rohrer [Moderator] 04/25/2019 14:27:57
A good approach would be that your main script starts an IPC server, and several instances of Webots on a single world containing a Supervisor listenening as a client on this IPC. The IPC can be a local TCPIP server, this is easy to setup in Python. There are many modules to do similar things. The main script may send events to the supervisor. Mainly it's about to evaluate some fitness, with data (neuron weights or so). In this case, the supervisor may reset the simulation typically by reseting the object position, or reloading the entire world (it's the purpose of a supervisor), and evaluate the fitness, and give the result back to the main script through the IPC.

##### El\_Samu\_El 04/25/2019 14:30:45
That sounds like something I was looking for. I will take some time to set this up and if it works I'll share this approach on github.


Thanks!

##### Fabien Rohrer [Moderator] 04/25/2019 14:31:45
you're welcome. Sharing your approach is a good way to thanks us ^^

##### Thelm76 04/26/2019 13:34:45
Hi, I'm trying to model a magnetic sensor in webots for e-puck, and I just realized that the output is only a vector whereas the magnetic sensor of e-pucks output a value in ¬µT for each axis. Is a lookup table sufficient to convert the compass into a magnetometer? If not, how can I manage to do this in the proto file?

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 04/26/2019 13:37:35
Hi, yes setting the lookupTable of the Compass node should be sufficient to calibrate your compass model in that case.

##### Thelm76 04/26/2019 13:40:55
So as I need the value to be between -4912 and 4912, will the output be a 3D vector with a fixed length, or the 3 the output are independent?

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 04/26/2019 13:41:42
The 3 output are independent.


They will match what you define in the lookup table.


Typically, your lookup table may look like this:


lookupTable [-1 -4912 0.1


1 4912 0.1 ]

##### Thelm76 04/26/2019 13:50:08
so if I do this, it will measure a magnetic field of 4912¬µT in the webots world right?

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 04/26/2019 13:52:37
I think so.


However in Webots, the Compass node gives a unit vector which is the direction of the north.


It's not a value expressed in ¬µT.

##### Thelm76 04/26/2019 13:56:30
I think for the lookup table it will be better to set [ -4912 -4912 0.1   4912 4912 0.1 ] that way, when I'll connect a real e-puck the measured values will be the good ones

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 04/26/2019 13:57:04
Yes, you certainly need to calibrate it with a real e-puck2 robot.

##### Thelm76 04/26/2019 13:57:58
Thank you, I'll wait to have a robot to try then


have a nice day üòÑ

Hey! Does Webot support controllers in Matlab for vehicles?

##### Fabien Rohrer [Moderator] 04/28/2019 11:56:29
Hi, unfortunately no. We created wrappers for C++, Python, Java and ROS, but not for Matlab yet.


I think that it should be fairly easy to do. Do you have  any resource for this development?

##### rittwiq 04/28/2019 12:46:04
No.... I was thinking of integrating with simulink... But if I was to use python or C++ do I need to make changes in my make file for vehicles?

##### Ahmad Ali 04/29/2019 01:54:04
Hi, I am trying to use a  C++ based external library in webots in Ubuntu and I got this error.

error: #error This file requires compiler and library support for the ISO C++ 2011 standard. This support must be enabled with the -std=c++11 or -std=gnu++11 compiler options.

how can I use support for the ISO CPP 2011 standard?

Regards

##### Fabien Rohrer [Moderator] 04/29/2019 04:06:44
`@rittwiq` it would be helpful to have a Matlab wrapper to start simulink. There are maybe other possibilities about to start Simulink directly.


To use Python and the vehicle library, you need to have a runtime.ini indicating to the controller where to find the vehicle library. You could copy it from any python example using the vehicle library.


For C++, you also need a custom Makefile and runtime.ini. There too, please simply refer to a released example.


`@Ahmad Ali` did you simply tried to add this option in your Makefile?


CFLAGS += -stdc++11

##### Ahmad Ali 04/29/2019 06:41:06
I tried "CFLAGS += -stdc++11"  in the Makefile, but I am still getting this error message,

`@Shounak`  the camera recognition API is available both for Python 2.7 and Python 3

##### Shounak 04/29/2019 06:53:46
yes. I been trying to run it


its not working

##### Stefania Pedrazzi [cyberbotics] 04/29/2019 06:57:19
here is the Python documentation: [https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/camera?tab=python](https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/camera?tab=python)


the Python call will be:

note that a Recognition nodes needs to be present in the Camera node and that you first have to enable the recognition

##### Shounak 04/29/2019 06:58:55
I have done that

##### Fabien Rohrer [Moderator] 04/29/2019 08:08:33
`@Ahmad Ali` It seems that some include files cannot be found. Your directories are certainly not well defined. Where is the "Core" file installed? You should try:


include = -I "/usr/include/eigen3

##### Stefania Pedrazzi [cyberbotics] 04/29/2019 08:11:56
`@Ahmad Ali`  it also seems that you are overwriting the "include" variable instead of adding multiple paths. You should use "+=" instead of "="

##### Ahmad Ali 04/29/2019 08:28:23
Thanks Stefania and Fabien,

Path of the Core file is "/usr/include/eigen3/Eigen/Core.h"



I tried  "include = -I "/usr/include/eigen3" ,  but the same error appears.


when I run the source file in Ubuntu terminal, then "-I/usr/include/eigen3" is working fine. But when I use code in Webots, then it gives the error

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 04/29/2019 08:34:05
Not sure if it makes a difference, but "include" should be written in capital letters, e.g., INCLUDE = -I /usr/include/eigen3

##### Ahmad Ali 04/29/2019 09:16:51
Thanks, its working now.

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 04/29/2019 09:17:18
So, capital letters were needed, right?

##### Ahmad Ali 04/29/2019 09:18:41
yes, exactly.

Do we use the naoqi in webots ?

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 04/29/2019 14:40:57
Yes, this is possible but not recommended.


Because SoftBank robotics is not maintaining the naoqi simulator-sdk and there are some bugs and limitation that won't get fixed.

##### kim 04/29/2019 14:42:42
so when we control the nao robot in real  we don't use the naoqi ?


from naoqi import ALProxy

tts = ALProxy("ALTextToSpeech", "<IP of your robot>", 9559)

tts.say("Hello, world!")


this code

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 04/29/2019 14:43:34
Yes, but that is the native version of naoqi. The simulated version of naoqi relies on the simulator-sdk from SoftBank Robotics.

how do i get the simulator-sdk from SoftBank Robotics?


do I have to buy?

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 04/29/2019 14:46:00
No, it's free.


Follow the instructions here: [https://github.com/omichel/naoqisim](https://github.com/omichel/naoqisim)


(basically, it gets installed when you install naoqisim for Webots)

##### kim 04/29/2019 14:49:00
I installed the naoqi in this web site


[https://community.ald.softbankrobotics.com/en/resources/software/language/en-gb](https://community.ald.softbankrobotics.com/en/resources/software/language/en-gb)


do you knwo?


know about this website?

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 04/29/2019 14:51:26
Yes, but it doesn't include the simulator-sdk.


The simulator-sdk was basically abandoned by SoftBank, this is why you cannot download it from their official site.


It is not maintained any more.


Hence this is why we don't recommend using it.


Instead you can program the simulated NAO robot in Webots directly in Python using the Webots API.

hello

##### Ahmad Ali 04/30/2019 08:06:11
Hi,

I am doing motion planning using OMPL (C++ based motion planning library) with Webots. But OMPL does not have its collision checking feature. In Webots, we can check collision using physics plug-in during the simulation. I am wandering if I can use collision checking feature of webots in motion planning (which will be outside the simulation loop).

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 04/30/2019 08:07:11
Hi,


You can probably write a physics plugin in Webots that will send collision information to your robot controller using the Emitter / Receiver system. This information could then be used by OMPL which I guess is linked with your robot controller.

##### Ahmad Ali 04/30/2019 08:22:16
in fact , the planning part is offline, that is why,  the code for planning is in controller but outside the simulation loop with time\_step. Is it possible to call collision detection  function directly in Controller?

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 04/30/2019 08:26:39
No, that's not possible. Instead you should actually run the simulation possibly with another controller that will be executed before your main controller and that would use run the simulation to perform only collision detection in the physics plug-in.

##### Ahmad Ali 04/30/2019 08:28:20
Thanks Mr Olivier for clearing my confusion.

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 04/30/2019 08:28:29
You are welcome.

##### Ahmad Ali 04/30/2019 08:29:04
I will try to use some other collision checking library for collision checking in motion planning.

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 05/01/2019 06:38:06
Is this memory leak specific to a certain simulation?


Oops... This version is not any more supported. I would recommend you to upgrade to Webots R2019a revision 1 as we won't fix version 8.5.4 even if you find a memory leak in there.

##### ‰πã‰πã 05/01/2019 06:39:40

Hi,

##### nisuunn 05/01/2019 14:00:35
I have an elevationGrid which I have defined and it works fine regarding collisions.

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 05/01/2019 14:00:56
All right.

##### nisuunn 05/01/2019 14:01:02
I also have a supervisor with which I change the parameters of the elevation grid


which change the height values


once activated,


visually the height change can be seen


however, collision does not seem to work as desired,


when some other object e.g. robot collides with the new elevationgrid, the collision seems to still be working with the old version of the elevationgrid

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 05/01/2019 14:02:34
I see.


That is likely a bug...

##### nisuunn 05/01/2019 14:02:46
I also noticed that before making the change, if I change the position of the elevationgrid, then the new elevationgrid with new heights works fine with respect to collision


I see


Aside from slightly changing the position of the elevation grid each time, is there any other way to get around this issue?

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 05/01/2019 14:03:44
Yes, fixing the bug inside Webots.


Can you open an issue at [https://github.com/omichel/webots/issues](https://github.com/omichel/webots/issues) and describe this bug precisely so that we can try to reproduce it?

##### nisuunn 05/01/2019 14:04:32

##### nisuunn 05/01/2019 14:04:59
the robot's boundingobject parameter


Right now I have left it undefined, and instead I have defined the bounding object of all the individual parts of the robot (such as foot, body, etc.)


Can this be a problem?

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 05/01/2019 14:06:58
It shouldn't be a problem. However, it is better to define a boundingObject for the robot. This bounding object usually represents the body of the robot (often the place where the CPU of the robot is) from which the other joints are connected to.

##### nisuunn 05/01/2019 14:07:31
I see, so in the case of a quadruped robot, should the main body torso be the boundingObject of the robot?

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 05/01/2019 14:07:39
Yes.

Hello, is it possible to make webots vehicles start with some specific initial velocity instead of zero?

##### Fabien Rohrer [Moderator] 05/01/2019 19:13:31
I think this is possible thanks to the hidden fields.


Just save a world while vehicles are running, and observe how ¬´¬†hiddenField¬†¬ª are stored in the .wbt file.

##### sai 05/01/2019 19:15:19
Ohh thats's a good idea. I can try it out thanks!!

##### Fabien Rohrer [Moderator] 05/01/2019 19:15:42
Here is the doc: [https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/proto-hidden-fields](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/proto-hidden-fields)


These parameters may be difficult to write manually.

##### sai 05/01/2019 19:20:29
Yeah that looks like it... Is there any source where I can understand how these parameters encode some specific velocity? Without that I could only try to check a couple of webots saved worlds with different velocities...

##### Fabien Rohrer [Moderator] 05/01/2019 19:26:44
Hidden fields are dealt in the WbSolid class: [https://github.com/omichel/webots/blob/931d04675d7dc69aa0599c4d525795bbbdd6193f/src/webots/nodes/WbSolid.cpp#L157](https://github.com/omichel/webots/blob/931d04675d7dc69aa0599c4d525795bbbdd6193f/src/webots/nodes/WbSolid.cpp#L157)

##### sai 05/01/2019 19:27:25
Thanks that could be helpful


Also, I have a question regarding the acceleration value being assigned infinity for a vehicle


What does it mean in a simulation? Does it make the vehicle instantaneously reach a specific velocity in cruise mode?

##### Fabien Rohrer [Moderator] 05/01/2019 19:35:57
The vehicles are supposed to be controlled using the libvehicle only which actually manage the acceleration

##### Sajjad 05/01/2019 20:41:40
hi, how I can my first project with Nao robot in webots?


Hi, I want to connect Webots to Choregraphe, how know about it? actually, ,I can't find nao\_qi !

##### sai 05/01/2019 23:45:22
Hello, does webots support thrustmaster tmx driving wheel. I want to control the vehicle using this thrustmaster wheel connected to pc

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 05/02/2019 06:25:52
`@Sajjad` , you need to install naoqisim in addition to Webots. Installation instructions are here: [https://github.com/omichel/naoqisim](https://github.com/omichel/naoqisim)


`@sai`, Webots works with the Logitech driving wheel and Fanatec driving wheels. We never tested the Thurstmaster, but it is likely to work as well. If not, it shouldn't be difficult to adapt the buttons and axis references in the source code of Webots.

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 05/02/2019 07:19:06
To be completely correct about the thrustmaster tmx driving wheel, the buttons and axis references are handled on the controller side, they can easily be changed in the configuration file (*.ini): [https://github.com/omichel/webots/tree/master/projects/vehicles/controllers/racing\_wheel](https://github.com/omichel/webots/tree/master/projects/vehicles/controllers/racing_wheel)

greetings, how do i add boost to webots?

##### Fabien Rohrer [Moderator] 05/02/2019 11:35:00
Hi, Boost can be added as any other third party library: [https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/using-webots-makefiles#adding-an-external-library-ccp](https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/using-webots-makefiles#adding-an-external-library-ccp)

##### kim 05/02/2019 15:19:56
hi


I wonder nao robot can be controlled using python3

##### Fabien Rohrer [Moderator] 05/02/2019 15:20:37
Hi, yes it can


Webots supports Python 3 on every OS. The Webots API can be used to control the Nao.

##### kim 05/02/2019 15:22:08
Is the Webots API  installed when I install the weobots?

##### Fabien Rohrer [Moderator] 05/02/2019 15:22:22
Yes


You should be able to test this example out-of-the-box: [https://github.com/omichel/webots/blob/master/projects/robots/softbank/nao/controllers/nao\_demo\_python/nao\_demo\_python.py](https://github.com/omichel/webots/blob/master/projects/robots/softbank/nao/controllers/nao_demo_python/nao_demo_python.py)


Please refer to this doc to run Python controllers: [https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/using-python](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/using-python)


(basically, you simply need to install Python 3 correctly)

##### kim 05/02/2019 15:25:10
What is the first code for?

##### Fabien Rohrer [Moderator] 05/02/2019 15:26:12
It's a demo controller for the Nao written in Python (2 or 3). A good starting point...

##### kim 05/02/2019 15:28:55
What is the Webots API exactly?

##### Fabien Rohrer [Moderator] 05/02/2019 15:29:58
It's simply the library (set of funtions) used to control the virtual robots: [https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/nodes-and-api-functions](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/nodes-and-api-functions)

##### kim 05/02/2019 15:31:02
So you mean that we can control the Nao robot using Webots API?

##### Fabien Rohrer [Moderator] 05/02/2019 15:32:03
Yes, as in the controller shown above.

##### kim 05/02/2019 15:32:17
control the robot in reality  not virtual environment


is it right?

##### Fabien Rohrer [Moderator] 05/02/2019 15:32:34
No, in reality, this is another story.

##### kim 05/02/2019 15:33:11
So do you know that we can control the Nao robot in reality using python?

##### Fabien Rohrer [Moderator] 05/02/2019 15:33:55
You should refer to the softbank documentation for this. I think yes. Not sure at all about Python 3.


At some point, we were developing a system with softbank to control both the real and the virtual robot, but they dropped it:


[https://github.com/omichel/naoqisim](https://github.com/omichel/naoqisim)


You can give this a try, but we do not support this anymore.

##### kim 05/02/2019 15:35:26
ok thanks !

##### Fabien Rohrer [Moderator] 05/02/2019 15:35:44

Yes, we tried this.

##### kim 05/02/2019 15:36:43

##### Chin I 05/02/2019 19:07:38
Hi, are there any step-by-step tutorials on Robotic Arm Simulations and how to write controllers for them?

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 05/03/2019 06:30:52
`@AntiSquid`, what is your GPU ? Have you been able to identify which OpenGL preference ([https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/preferences#opengl](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/preferences#opengl))  cause the crash ?


`@Chin I`  unfortunately not yet, however you can find generic step-by-step tutorials here: [https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/tutorials](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/tutorials).

In these tutorials you will learn (amongst other) how to control motors which is what you need for controlling Robotic Arms.

By the way, do you have a specific robotic arm in mind?

##### AntiSquid 05/03/2019 11:43:52
`@David Mansolino` no idea what caused the crash. I am not sure it's the GPU (Intel¬Æ HD Graphics 4400)

i reset all the world settings and it worked again, there seems to be an issue with webots (for me) when i try to use physics, but it might be the physics dll i use is bugged

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 05/03/2019 12:13:59
That's indeed higly possible, has the physics dll is loaded by Webots directly, if there is a crash in the physics plugin, Webots will crash as well.

##### Thelm76 05/03/2019 12:16:04
Hi, would it be possible to make multiple e-pucks communicating with each other (e.g. by WiFi or Bluetooth) with cross compliation?


I will use e-pucks v2

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 05/03/2019 12:17:15
Hi, this is not supported out of the box, if you are using remote-control you might use emitter-receiver. But with remote-control you will need to implement this by yourself.

##### Thelm76 05/03/2019 12:27:41
So for now I have to leave webots connected to e-pucks. Also I've found some examples on forums, of people trying to use LibIrcom, which permit to send data by the IR sensors, but I can't find any examples of working codes. So I think I will give up the cross-compilation idea for now and stay with the remote control thing


because the cross compilation seems to be too incomplete for what I want to do

##### Fabien Rohrer [Moderator] 05/05/2019 12:42:17
`@Wei` Shadows is more a matter of enabling the Light.castShadow field: [https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/light](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/light)


`@Akash` Did you look at the Compass.lookupTable field? [https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/compass](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/compass)


`@el` Indeed, installing opencv is a good idea. If the OpenCV released in Webots is problematic, you could take a look at your LD\_LIBRARY\_PATH environment variable, and make sure your OpenCV appears first.


I also think that OpenCV is only used in some examples in Webots. So you could also simply remove the related files from Webots.

The Mantis is certainly the most advanced hexapod we have in Webots: [https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/mantis](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/mantis)


`@leoliako9595` you should simply install opencv and link it with your controller as described here [https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/using-webots-makefiles#adding-an-external-library-ccp](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/using-webots-makefiles#adding-an-external-library-ccp)

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 05/08/2019 08:43:41
`@‡º∫Yatori‡ºª` yes you can add new node (e.g. DistanceSensor nodes) in the 'turretSlot' field of the E-puck node.


`@CH_KIM` the duration is in millisecond which means the biggest frequency you can have is 1khz (which is already quite high for a control loop).

##### CH\_KIM 05/08/2019 08:51:36
um... ok


not change the duration value, any solution about my problem.

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 05/08/2019 08:55:06

why this error shows


this function can only be used in a 'Supervisor' controller.


I correct it


but when robot translate to new position, the speed is so high and rotate is it natural?

##### el 05/12/2019 12:12:26
hello üòÉ  well i want to take a camera frame and the next camera frame and implement a feature matching algorithm using opencv. but as seen in the above code i take the first frame 2 times cause i am in the same timestep .how to take 2 frames one after the other from 2 timwsteps?

the feature matching algorythm works fine but i dont know how to take two frames one after the other

Hi I want to enable GPS on e puck in python. Any link or reference that would help

`@fateme` you should  reset the physics of your robot after translate it by calling wb\_supervisor\_node\_reset\_physics [https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/supervisor#wb\_supervisor\_node\_reset\_physics](https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/supervisor#wb_supervisor_node_reset_physics)


`@Amey`  you should first add the GPS device in the 'turretSlot' of the e-puck because by default the e-puck model doesn't have it. The gps works exactly as all the other sensors. You can for example look at projects/robots/softbank/nao/worlds/nao\_demo.wbt for an example for the Nao robot that uses a GPS  or at projects/languages/python/worlds/example.wbt for a more simple and generic example of how to use sensors in Python

Here is the GPS documentation: [https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/gps?tab=python](https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/gps?tab=python)


`@el` in order to get two consecutive frames you have to call `wb_robot_step` function in between. So you have to store the previous camera image and use it in the next `while (wb_robot_step() != -1)` run.

##### Karl 05/14/2019 20:30:27
Do I really need to compile WeBots when making a custom remote control, or am I missing something?


Or, more generally: Does anyone know how to build a custom remote control with CMake?

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 05/15/2019 06:24:06
Hi Karl,


You don't need to recompile Webots to create a custom remote control.


You just need to compile your own remote-control library.


A remote control library is a simple shared library (DLL on Windows, .so on Linux, .dylib on mac OS)


You can compile it with any C compiler, using CMake or any other build tool.


We provide examples of remote-control libraries built with gcc and Makefile, but you are free to use other tools.


See the documentation here: [https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/transfer-to-your-own-robot#developing-a-remote-control-plugin](https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/transfer-to-your-own-robot#developing-a-remote-control-plugin)

When I start ubuntu with ' webots --minimize --stdout' ion ubuntu, it still opens the GUI and prints partly some messages on terminal and on webots console. Is this a known bug or am I doing something wrong?

##### Karl 05/15/2019 09:18:49

##### Fabien Rohrer [Moderator] 05/15/2019 09:19:40
Could you try to add `--batch` option?

##### El\_Samu\_El 05/15/2019 09:20:02
yes


does not change anything really

##### Fabien Rohrer [Moderator] 05/15/2019 09:20:26
Webots requires the GUI, it's currently not possible to run Webots without GUI

##### El\_Samu\_El 05/15/2019 09:20:58
that's fine, but I need the output on the console

##### Fabien Rohrer [Moderator] 05/15/2019 09:21:07
But normally, most messages should be redirected  on the console.


which messages are not redirected?

##### El\_Samu\_El 05/15/2019 09:21:21
because webots tends to print in the wrong order or does not at all if the program isn't terminating


error messages are shown in the webots console


while print statements are shown in the terminal

##### Fabien Rohrer [Moderator] 05/15/2019 09:23:38
Ok. Could I kindly ask you to fill a bug report here: [https://github.com/omichel/webots/issues](https://github.com/omichel/webots/issues) mentionning your OS, the Webots version, and an example of a message not working (screenshot)? We will help you there.

`@SamuelKopp`: did you try to use the --stdout and --stderr command line options of Webots? Is it what you need?

üëç

##### El\_Samu\_El 05/15/2019 09:27:52
No, I missed stderr. Thanks! But that --minimize is not working is known, right?

##### Fabien Rohrer [Moderator] 05/15/2019 09:28:51
It's supposed to work. On which OS are you working?

##### El\_Samu\_El 05/15/2019 09:29:04
Ubuntu 18.04

##### Fabien Rohrer [Moderator] 05/15/2019 09:32:29
This option is supposed to launch Webots but minimized. Do you see the window in such case?

##### El\_Samu\_El 05/15/2019 09:34:33
yes, it opens in exactly the same position and layout as when I opened it the last time normally

##### Stefania Pedrazzi [cyberbotics] 05/15/2019 09:34:57
I checked and I get the same issue on Ubuntu 18.04 with minimize.

##### Fabien Rohrer [Moderator] 05/15/2019 09:36:23
Yes, me too


I'm opening issue


[https://github.com/omichel/webots/issues/453](https://github.com/omichel/webots/issues/453)


`@El_Samu_El` please follow this issue to be aware about its resolution.

##### El\_Samu\_El 05/15/2019 10:00:43
So the other issue is that webots print statements are somewhat delayed in the execution order. If my program does not terminate, then they are not printed at all. This makes debugging really hard.

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 05/15/2019 10:03:17
Do you get this even with the --stdout and --stderr options?

##### El\_Samu\_El 05/15/2019 10:03:37
yes, the output is  the same as in the webots console

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 05/15/2019 10:03:43
Did you try to call fflush(stdout) after printfs?

##### El\_Samu\_El 05/15/2019 10:03:48
i am using python


will try

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 05/15/2019 10:04:28
Did you try to set the PYTHONUNBUFFERED environment variable?

##### El\_Samu\_El 05/15/2019 10:04:48
no, I didn't read about that


thanks


flushing does not help, i'll try it with the env variable


setting PYTHONUNBUFFERED does not help either

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 05/15/2019 10:15:53
Oops... Can you try writing into a file?

##### El\_Samu\_El 05/15/2019 10:31:09
yeah that works perfectly

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 05/15/2019 10:36:35
This is strange, I don't understand why you can't get the same on stdout/stderr...

##### El\_Samu\_El 05/15/2019 10:49:52
it just outputs "controller\_name": Starting: "python3 -u "filename.py"


then it ignores the print statement in the first line  even with flush


keyboard interrupt doesn't help with showing what is printed

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 05/15/2019 10:58:02
Do you mean the print in the Terminal (with --stderr --stdout) or in the Webots console?

##### El\_Samu\_El 05/15/2019 10:58:20
both is equivalent

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 05/15/2019 10:58:28

Hi


I'm using a supervisor to create new objects at runtime.


Once they've spawned, how would I get a handle to these newly created objects?


I would use the getFromDef function, but if many of the same objects are spawned, they'd all have the same DEF,

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 05/15/2019 12:49:07
Hi


You can either define different def when spawning them or retrieve them with the  wb\_supervisor\_field\_get\_mf\_node function ([https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/supervisor#wb\_supervisor\_field\_get\_mf\_node](https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/supervisor#wb_supervisor_field_get_mf_node)) , you can use '-1' as index to get the latest imported node.

Hi! I have a problem when connecting e-puck by bluetooth to webots as it says "wbr\_motor\_set\_position was called but not set". In the code the only time I call this method is in an init function to set the motors in velocity control mode :

wheels[i].setPosition(float('+inf'))

wheels[i].setVelocity(0)



but the program works just fine in the simulation

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 05/17/2019 12:20:14
Hi, did you try to run the sample e-puck controllers with a remote controlled robot?


If so, did that work?

##### Thelm76 05/17/2019 12:29:06
yes the sample crontrollers are working fine ....


but I'm progrmming in python

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 05/17/2019 12:30:38
Strange... Did you try to make the same kind of motor control as in the C sample? E.g., control in speed rather than in position?

##### Thelm76 05/17/2019 13:13:35
yes, actually, at first I tried to do a position control in python. then I had this messages so I tried to do a velocity control


I also tried to put a robot.set(3000) to give time to establish the connection

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 05/17/2019 13:20:53
robot.step(3000) is probably useless. It should work fine with a robot.step(100) value or so.

yes but it's still not working fine..... I'll try to make the same controller in C it maybe will solve the problem

Hello, I have two controllers, one for my robot and one for a supervisor. Is it possible  from the controller of the supervisor to stop/exit the controller of the robot ? I am working in C++.

##### Stefania Pedrazzi [cyberbotics] 05/20/2019 06:23:42
Hi `@Amey` , ostacle avoidance is a research topic in robotics and there are many different ways to achieve it. You can find many examples in the provided simulations, I would suggest you to run the Webots Guided Tour and look at the different controller programs. 

We often use the Breitenberg algorithm ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Braitenberg\_vehicle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Braitenberg_vehicle)), for example in

- robots/gctronic/worlds/e-puck.wbt

- samples/robotbenchmark/obstacle\_avoidance/worlds/obstacle\_avoidance.wbt


Hi `@Jeremy` , you cannot stop it directly, but you can notify the robot controller to stop by the supervisor controller and handle the stop message in the robot controller. For example you can use the Emitter/Receiver ([https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/emitter](https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/emitter)) devices to send the stop message from the supervisor to the robot.

##### Thelm76 05/20/2019 14:54:26

```

##### Fabien Rohrer [Moderator] 05/20/2019 14:55:33
Hi


It means that your controller is linked with a remote control library (cf. Robot.remoteControl field) where wbr\_motor\_set\_position should be set.


=> wbr\_motor\_set\_position is not defined in this library.

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 05/20/2019 14:57:49
For information position control for the e-puck in remote-control is not supported with the remote-control library distributed with Webots: [https://github.com/omichel/webots/blob/revision/projects/robots/gctronic/e-puck/plugins/remote\_controls/e-puck\_bluetooth/entry\_points.cpp#L31](https://github.com/omichel/webots/blob/revision/projects/robots/gctronic/e-puck/plugins/remote_controls/e-puck_bluetooth/entry_points.cpp#L31)

##### Thelm76 05/20/2019 15:00:29
Okay thank you, i'll try to do without but I would be harder with just velocity control because of the wb\_robot\_step not properly workng with bluetooth

##### el 05/21/2019 13:28:09
which is the default focal length and  principle point of the epucks camera?

##### Fabien Rohrer [Moderator] 05/21/2019 13:29:39
Hi el


This is defined in the E-puck.proto file, let me check...


[https://github.com/omichel/webots/blob/master/projects/robots/gctronic/e-puck/protos/E-puck.proto#L20](https://github.com/omichel/webots/blob/master/projects/robots/gctronic/e-puck/protos/E-puck.proto#L20)


The field of view is by default 0.84 radians and this is an open field (it can be modified).


The focal length and the principal point are different concepts.


Focal length, principal point and field of view are related with this equation: [https://www.edmundoptics.fr/resources/application-notes/imaging/understanding-focal-length-and-field-of-view/](https://www.edmundoptics.fr/resources/application-notes/imaging/understanding-focal-length-and-field-of-view/)


But Webots allows to define the horizontal field of view only.


Does this answer your question?


Webots can also simulate depth of field blur. In this case, the focal distance can be set: [https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/focus](https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/focus)


This is not enabled by default on the e-puck

##### Mark - AgJunction 05/21/2019 21:43:31

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 05/22/2019 07:08:16
I would rather keep it on the controller side, but if you want to make it a bit modular you can wrap this in a library that you can call from each of your controller (so that you don't cuplicate the code in each controller).

I can't use simple while (!condition) because I need to execute other pieces of code at the same time

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 05/23/2019 06:13:41
`@Thelm76` since in remote-control you will communicate with the robot only during the step function, the only way to do this is to check the encoder position at each step. If you want something really precise, the only way is to implement position cotnrol directly in the robot library: [https://github.com/omichel/webots/blob/revision/projects/robots/gctronic/e-puck/transfer/library/motor\_led/advance\_one\_timer/e\_motors.c](https://github.com/omichel/webots/blob/revision/projects/robots/gctronic/e-puck/transfer/library/motor_led/advance_one_timer/e_motors.c)

Hi

##### nisuunn 05/23/2019 13:15:26
I would like to import a robot (robot node) using a supervisor. I'm trying to use childField.importMFNode(index, robotPath), where childField is the children field of a transform node, however Webots does not let me do this as you cannot import robot nodes into children fields of transform fields


is there any way for me to spawn in a robot using the inmportMFNode(), or in any other way?

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 05/23/2019 13:16:09
Yes of course, let me explain


First, it is better to import you robot at the root level, you can get the root field with something like this:

supervisor.getRoot().getField('children')


Then you can import anything in this field

##### nisuunn 05/23/2019 13:17:53
ah okay, perfect, many thanks!

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 05/23/2019 13:18:04
You may also be interested by the 'importMFNodeFromString' function


you can do something like:

supervisor.getRoot().getField('children').importMFNodeFromString('Robot { translation 1 0 2 }')


You're welcome

##### nisuunn 05/23/2019 13:19:44
I see, thanks again!


I'm using supervisor.getRoot().getField('children')


and into that children field I spawn my desired robot


(i'm using importMFNode(index, path))


however, instead of spawning only one robot, it keeps spawning in the same robot forever, so that more and more of these robots are created in the same exact space, I think the code does not get past this spawning point.


Is there any way around this issue?

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 05/23/2019 13:38:16
Do you call the ` importMFNode(index, path)` function at each step ?

##### nisuunn 05/23/2019 13:40:08
no


in one function which is called once

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 05/23/2019 13:40:37
Does the robot that you spawn have the same controller as the one spawning the robot ?

##### nisuunn 05/23/2019 13:40:44
yes


the same supervisor

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 05/23/2019 13:41:36
Then this is probably the problem:

 step0: original robot spawn robot 1

step1: robot1 spawn robot2

step2: robot2 spawn robot3

...

##### nisuunn 05/23/2019 13:42:42

Hello



Has anyone ever worked with line follower with Webots, ROS and python at the same time?

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 05/24/2019 06:17:21
Hi, not in Python, but this example perform simple line following with the epuck robot using ROS in C++: [https://github.com/omichel/webots/blob/revision/projects/languages/ros/webots\_ros/src/e\_puck\_line.cpp](https://github.com/omichel/webots/blob/revision/projects/languages/ros/webots_ros/src/e_puck_line.cpp)

##### moon 05/24/2019 06:31:57
Hi everyone! I am studying this tutorial from youtube channel Cyberbotics  (link is [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRvFJDuhx3Y&t=303s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRvFJDuhx3Y&t=303s)). So here after executing rosrun gmapping slam\_gmapping scan:=/pioneer3at/ command, rviz has to show map. But not my RViz. It shows a warning message "no map received". So after I have installed slam\_gmapping package, but it doesn't helpful. I have tried to write own launch file, but it seems like doesn't useful for pioneer3at, or I don't know. Anyway, it did not work. So, can you help me&

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 05/24/2019 06:36:15
Hi, in the terminal you launched gmapping do you have any error messages or can you see that it is updating the map?

##### moon 05/24/2019 06:48:43
no, there is no errors

%end

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 05/24/2019 06:50:18
No error but nothing is printed, gmapping should print each time it is computing updates. Is the simulation running ?


If yes, does the robo move?


Is there any error in the webots console ?

##### moon 05/24/2019 07:01:19
webots also doesn't show any error

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 05/24/2019 07:01:57
But the camera doesn't seems enabled... Does the robot move?


Did you start the 'pioneer3at' ros node ?

##### moon 05/24/2019 07:05:16
camera and robot work

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 05/24/2019 07:05:55
Perfect and now if you start gmapping after that does it prints something (the order in which you start the node might be important)

##### moon 05/24/2019 07:18:24
no, the  same...

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 05/24/2019 07:19:09
Can you check if the sick is pucblishing laser\_scan ?

##### moon 05/24/2019 07:59:02
laser also works well.

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 05/24/2019 08:05:58
I am sorrry but I can't help you further, if the laser scan is correctly published from the Webots side gamping should produce the map, this is more a ROS problem than a Webots problem.

Maybe someone more familiar to ROS could help you.


Maybe you could also try to visualize the lascer\_scan in rviz just to check if they make sense

##### moon 05/24/2019 08:11:01
Thank you a lot! I've tried to visualize laser scan by RViz, and there were appearing little dots, outside of the grid,  which hard to see.
%figure
![9.png](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/565154703139405824/581393708214124544/9.png)
%end

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 05/24/2019 08:13:12
Indeed they are hard to see, you should probably change the color of the dot and make sure the  size of the grid is similar to the size of the floor in Webots, then in Webots you can enable the optional rendering 'View->Optional Rendering->Show Lidar Point Cloud' and check if the shapes of the points are similar in Webots and RViz

##### moon 05/24/2019 08:23:38
I've already solved! I had to skip this step, I wrote " rosrun gmapping slam\_gmapping scan:=/pioneer3at/Sick\_LMS\_291/laser\_scan/layer0 \_xmax:=30 \_xmin:=-30 \_ymax:=30 \_ymin:=-30 \_delta:=0.2", as shown in the tutorial, and everything works! Thank you for your help!!

Hi, ok good news!

##### TH0 05/24/2019 09:57:24
Hi!



i'm currently working on a more realistic version of the Nao-Robocup-Simulator. I already changed some materials, textures and other things in the proto files:
%figure
![webots1.png](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/565154703139405824/581420477193650186/webots1.png)
%end

%end


but i wonder if there is maybe a visual tool to edit the proto files instead of using a text editor? Because my current workflow is extremly ineffective and i am not able to edit the geometry of objects by myself except editing the raw coordinates in the proto files -\_-



Can you recommend a tool for editing proto files and create or change webots objects efficiently?

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 05/24/2019 10:00:06
Hi, very nice simulation !!

##### TH0 05/24/2019 10:00:22
thanks üòÉ i will share it when its finished

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 05/24/2019 10:01:15
To edit the mesh we usually use Blender, we have created a plugin to be able to export directly from Blender to Webots (but you can also export in VRML from blender and import it in Webots): [https://github.com/omichel/blender-webots-exporter](https://github.com/omichel/blender-webots-exporter)


Very cool, looking forward to see it !

##### TH0 05/24/2019 10:02:24
ok, and how about importing already existing geometry (like the nao.proto) in blender ?

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 05/24/2019 10:02:51
Abotu editing the PROTO, it is sometimes difficult indeed to edit directly in text file, for this you can right click on the PROTO node in Webots and press on 'Convert to Base Node(s)' this will 'unprototize' the robot for you.


You can export your robot in vrml from Webots and then import it in Webots, you might loose some information in the precess but at least the meshes (which is what is interesting to edit in blender) should be fine.

##### TH0 05/24/2019 10:04:19
ok, cool, i will try that!

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 05/24/2019 10:04:41
Do not hesitate to ask us if you have problem with one specific step

##### TH0 05/24/2019 10:05:39
ok, thanks! i have a ton of other questions, but one after another üòÑ

Good idea üòâ

##### newcomer\_523 05/24/2019 12:52:21
Hello, can anybody tell me how i can change the type of a distance sensor from the  generic type to infra-red type?

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 05/24/2019 12:52:32
Hello


yes, you simply have to change the 'type' field of the corresponding DistanceSensor node.

##### newcomer\_523 05/24/2019 12:54:37
Thanks for this fast response üòÉ Could you tell me how i can do this in C?  I just started using webots and programming with C.

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 05/24/2019 12:55:28
You should not do this from the controller, but manually in the Webots scene-tree.


I strongly recommend to do our tutorial (at least the first 7) to get familiar with Webots: [https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/tutorials](https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/tutorials)

##### newcomer\_523 05/24/2019 12:56:07
thank you very much üòÑ

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 05/24/2019 12:56:18
You're welcome

##### Noji 05/25/2019 04:10:58

I think this is a very basic problem. Sorry for bothering you.

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 05/27/2019 06:12:33
`@Noji`, the simplest solution is to use the 'Tools->Restore Layout' menu

##### Markacho 05/27/2019 08:36:31
Can someone tell me if the Boomer 3050 tractor model can be modified?

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 05/27/2019 09:22:40
Yes of course, you can modify any PROTO node distributed with Webots.

##### Markacho 05/27/2019 09:23:08
Thanks.  I just found it:  Tractor.proto

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 05/27/2019 09:23:21

hi, how can i use the lidar with khepera IV and where can i fin th source code thank you

##### Fabien Rohrer [Moderator] 05/27/2019 14:48:11
Hi

##### Ya 05/27/2019 14:48:23
Hi

##### Fabien Rohrer [Moderator] 05/27/2019 14:48:40
You should start by running the khepera4.wbt example:

##### Ya 05/27/2019 14:48:54
yes i do it

##### Fabien Rohrer [Moderator] 05/27/2019 14:49:03
[https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/khepera4#khepera4-wbt](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/khepera4#khepera4-wbt)

##### Ya 05/27/2019 14:49:47
also i modifaded the source code of khepera 4


you have an amazing simulator

##### Fabien Rohrer [Moderator] 05/27/2019 14:51:01
Then you should add a Lidar node to the Khepera4.turretSlot



%figure
![Capture_decran_2019-05-27_a_16.50.40.png](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/565154703139405824/582581579042390027/Capture_decran_2019-05-27_a_16.50.40.png)
%end


save the simulation.


Now, the Lidar should be accessible in the controller, using the Lidar API:


[https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/lidar](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/lidar)

##### Ya 05/27/2019 14:51:57
there is a source code to use the lidar ?

##### Fabien Rohrer [Moderator] 05/27/2019 14:52:44
The documentation above describes all the lidar functions.


You could refer to the lidar example:


[https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/samples-devices#lidar-wbt](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/samples-devices#lidar-wbt)


The controller (lidar.c) of this example shows how to use the API in a working situation.


Thank you ^^

##### Ya 05/27/2019 15:03:41
all the best ^^

##### Noji 05/27/2019 15:27:34
Dear `@David Mansolino` Thanks a lot! I tried 'Tools->Restore Layout'. First, the window did not change, but after restarting Webots, 3D view was shown again.

hello, we are looking for a warehouse environment in webots human-robot interaction experiments. I couldn't find much in the default environment samples. Is there an external source for such environments or do we have to build it from scratch?? Thanks in advance

##### Fabien Rohrer [Moderator] 05/29/2019 06:00:56
Hi, we have a set of predefined assets that can be easily put together to create such kind of environment:


For example here: [https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/object-factory](https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/object-factory)

##### sai 05/29/2019 06:01:57
Ok thanks, I will have a look

##### Fabien Rohrer [Moderator] 05/29/2019 06:03:59
If this is not sufficient, we could create new assets and a demo example, if you have some budget for this.

##### sai 05/29/2019 06:04:58
I see, I will have to discuss with my advisor. We will let you know if needed, thanks!!


I have another question. How flexible is the process of importing vrml designs into webots. I haven't tried it before but is it possible to import complex object like a factory machine or something designed in CAD, exported as a vrml format and importing it into webots?

##### Fabien Rohrer [Moderator] 05/29/2019 06:40:03
The Webots language is very close to VRML (subset + extension) and provides VRML import/export tools. Using blender at some point and its exporter plugin is often required [https://github.com/omichel/blender-webots-exporter](https://github.com/omichel/blender-webots-exporter) for example to create low poly meshes. Setting the physics parameters may also require supplementary passes.  Cyberbotics has a lot of expertise in this field.

##### sai 05/29/2019 06:43:32
That sounds great. thanks

##### Deleted User 05/29/2019 10:32:33
Hi, I'm trying to  run Webots remotely on a google cloud VM-Instance. However,  Im running into some issues with OpenGL. Specifically, its giving me these errors: libGL error: No matching fbConfigs or visuals found

libGL error: failed to load driver: swrast

libGL error: No matching fbConfigs or visuals found

libGL error: failed to load driver: swrast

Warning: Unrecognized OpenGL version


I was wondering if you might be able to help me out?


ERROR: Unable to load OpenGL functions!


It throws this error as well

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 05/29/2019 10:34:13
You need to have a GPU enabled compute node or setup a virtual frame buffer (xvfb).


Or xf86-video-dummy (Xdummy).

##### Deleted User 05/29/2019 10:37:58
Thanks for the response! Do I need to do this on the VM-Instance or my own computer? Since, others are using the same server to run webots remotely and they do not run into this issue.

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 05/29/2019 10:38:47
On the VM instance.


But wait, is the display of Webots redirected to your computer?

##### Deleted User 05/29/2019 10:39:06
yes it is

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 05/29/2019 10:39:32
In that case, forget about the virtual frame buffer, you simply need to redirect the DISPLAY to your computer.


With export DISPLAY / xhost+

##### Deleted User 05/29/2019 10:40:58
I think it is already redirected to my computer


it starts xquartz and shows a webots window in xquartz


however after this it throws the opengl errors and crashes

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 05/29/2019 10:42:05
Oops... Then, I am afraid I don't know how to help you with that...


Can run other OpenGL based applications? like glxgears?

##### Deleted User 05/29/2019 10:44:15
I have not tried this I'll test it and see what happens, thanks!


One more question regarding the xvfb


If I set it up on the VM-Instance running in the cloud, would I then be able to run webots completely on the VM-instance even though it doesnt have an actual display?

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 05/29/2019 10:47:34
Yes.

##### Deleted User 05/29/2019 10:48:07

##### Lifebinder (tsampazk) 05/29/2019 15:39:36
Hello, is there a way to reset the position (translation) of a robot through a different controller (supervisor), without reverting the simulation, etc.? We are using python

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 05/29/2019 15:40:30
Hi, yes of course, this is exmplained in detail here: [https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/using-numerical-optimization-methods#using-the-wb\_supervisor\_field\_set\_-and-wb\_supervisor\_simulation\_reset\_physics-functions](https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/using-numerical-optimization-methods#using-the-wb_supervisor_field_set_-and-wb_supervisor_simulation_reset_physics-functions)


The example is in C, but you can find all the equivalent functions in Python

##### Lifebinder (tsampazk) 05/29/2019 15:52:14
follow up question,  we are able to get the translation field through "robotNode.getField('translation')" but then cant find the equivalent to "

wb\_supervisor\_field\_set\_sf\_vec3f(trans\_field, INITIAL\_TRANS);" from the example.

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 05/29/2019 15:54:58
The 'robotNode.getField('translation')' function will return a Field object, you therefore have to keep it and use it:

  translationField = robotNode.getField('translation')

  translationField.setSFVec3f(INITIAL\_TRANS)


([https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/supervisor?tab=python#wb\_supervisor\_node\_get\_field](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/supervisor?tab=python#wb_supervisor_node_get_field) and [https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/supervisor?tab=python#wb\_supervisor\_field\_set\_sf\_vec3f](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/supervisor?tab=python#wb_supervisor_field_set_sf_vec3f))

Is there an issue with this portion of the tutorial documentation (see attached)?  I'm getting a Python error, complaining that "Motor wheels = []"  has a syntax error.

Instead, this simple code worked:



from controller import Robot

wheelsNames = ['wheel1', 'wheel2']

wheels = []

for i, name in enumerate(wheelsNames):

    wheels.append(robot.getMotor(name))

    wheels[i].setPosition(float('inf'))

    wheels[i].setVelocity(speed)



timestep = int(robot.getBasicTimeStep())

while robot.step(timestep) != -1:

##### Mr. Scruff 05/30/2019 20:16:36
Hi `@Fabien Rohrer` .  If I simply replace ¬´ Motor wheels = [] ¬ª by ¬´ wheels = [] ¬ª

then the following Python error appears:  "NameError: name 'robot' is not defined"

##### Fabien Rohrer [Moderator] 05/30/2019 20:18:17
<@272974104523702273> did you defined the ¬´¬†robot¬†¬ª variable above?


`@Luiz Felipe` are you sure you are above the minimal requirements to run Webots and that your GPU drivers are up to date?


[https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/system-requirements](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/system-requirements)


You could also try the safe mode: [https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/starting-webots#safe-mode](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/starting-webots#safe-mode)

##### Mr. Scruff 05/30/2019 20:34:06
`@Fabien Rohrer` , if I define the robot variable:  ¬´ robot = Robot()¬ª 

then I get the error: "name 'Robot' is not defined"



But, if I define the robot variable ¬´ robot = Robot()¬ª 

and change 

 ¬´from controller import Motor¬ª 

to

 ¬´from controller import Robot¬ª 

Then everything works fine.



If the above is correct, then the tutorial example code needs to change in 2 places, to:

 ¬´from controller import Robot¬ª

and

¬´ robot = Robot()¬ª


Oh, and 

wheels = []

Hi,


<@272974104523702273>: This is already fixed here: [https://github.com/omichel/webots/pull/496](https://github.com/omichel/webots/pull/496)


Regarding the "from controller import Robot", I believe there is no need to repeat it at this point as it should already be part of your Python controller (e.g., before adding the motor API).

##### Mr. Scruff 05/31/2019 06:26:40
HI `@Olivier Michel` .   How about ¬´from controller import Motor¬ª ?  Should it also be removed?

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 05/31/2019 06:28:10
Not sure whether it is strictly necessary if "from controller import Robot" was done before. Let me check...

##### Mr. Scruff 05/31/2019 06:29:43
Thanks.

I'm a bit concerned about omitting the steps that auto filled by the controller wizard.  In my opinion, it is better for the student if all code lines are included.

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 05/31/2019 06:29:44
Indeed, it is not necessary, but in theory could be useful to benefit from 100% of the Motor API.

##### Mr. Scruff 05/31/2019 06:31:04
Don't forget to add

¬´ robot = Robot()¬ª

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 05/31/2019 06:31:29
What is missing in the Python template? The "robot = Robot()" is there.


(added by the Python controller wizard)

##### Mr. Scruff 05/31/2019 06:32:40
Ah, yes.  That is the confusion about not including the statements provided by the wizard.


A recommendation then, is to add a section at the end that shows how the entire code should look like.  That will make sure there is no confusion.  Just a suggestion.

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 05/31/2019 06:36:59
Please feel free to contribute such a suggestion on github:  [https://github.com/omichel/webots/edit/master/docs/guide/tutorial-6-4-wheels-robot.md](https://github.com/omichel/webots/edit/master/docs/guide/tutorial-6-4-wheels-robot.md)


We will quickly review your suggestion and merge it in the Webots documentation.

This problem is more complex that it could appear in a first glance. Computing the robot odometry could give based on motor position sensor could give good results on wheeled robots (cf. E-puck go to example in the curriculum). Cheating with a perfect GPS and Compass is another solution (cf. Moose sample). Ultimately when obstacles are present, implementing a SLAM algo may be required. You should think about using a library like gmapping.

That's the guided tour, it is normal that this window pops-up the first time you start Webots, what happens when you click on 'Next' ? And 'Close' ?

##### smruti 06/03/2019 07:01:41
There's no respond while clicking next or close button .It just  closes automatically.

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 06/03/2019 07:05:21
Ok, can you please:

  1. check what is you GPU?

  2. make sure the GPU drivers are up to date.

  3. try launahcing Webots in safe mode: [https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/starting-webots#safe-mode](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/starting-webots#safe-mode)

##### Mr. Scruff 06/03/2019 14:16:47
I am using the Web Animations feature, which saves object information to a JSON file.   Is there an API available, so I can save other simulation information to this JSON file, such as GPS and IMU telemetry?

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 06/03/2019 14:18:05
Hi, unfortunately, this is not possible out of the box.


But you can implement it from the source code of Webots if needed.


Alternatively, you may save the GPS and IMU telemetry information from your controller program into a different JSON file.


With the same time stamp as the web animation JSON.


So that you can merge the two JSON files afterwards.

##### Mr. Scruff 06/03/2019 14:24:55

I am trying to program an OP2 bot and I'm confused on how to call the various motion files. I'm looking at the guide, but I'm not sure how to initiate it in the code. Sorry I'm a beginner at this.

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 06/04/2019 06:50:54
hi `@JustDN`, you need to create an instance of the motion manager:


RobotisOp2MotionManager *manager = new RobotisOp2MotionManager(robot);


then you can call the 'playPage' function:


manager->playPage(int id);


You can find the complete documentation here: [https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/robotis-op2#motion-manager](https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/robotis-op2#motion-manager)

Dear all

I would like to ask a question.

In Webots, it is possible that 1. Embed a panel/display/monitor in the environment. And 2. Play a video on the display in the simulated environment?

Thank you in advance.

##### Fabien Rohrer [Moderator] 06/04/2019 11:44:23
Hi


Yes, this is possible


The Display API allows to load an image as a texture in the world.


[https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/display#wb\_display\_image\_load](https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/display#wb_display_image_load)


The movie should be send image by image using this API.


However, I think this approach will be very slow.


Indeed, the Display is not optimized to stream images.


If performance is an issue, I would rather recommend to implement a MovieTexture node, but this is a complex task.

##### Xiangxiao 06/04/2019 13:08:19
Hi Fabien Rohrer , thank you very much for the information. I will check the it.


BYW, `@Fabien Rohrer`  do you know, is there anyone has done this before?

##### Fabien Rohrer [Moderator] 06/04/2019 13:18:36
I tried this once ^^


In apartment.wbt, there is a television on. A movie showing the nao is displayed.


But this is a trick, a big image is loaded at startup, and the Display only change the x-y position of the image at each step.

##### JustDN 06/04/2019 15:04:44
For the OP2, is there a way to call each individual motor? I've tried using WbDeviceTag shoulderR = wb\_robot\_get\_device("ShoulderR"); and then setting the position using wb\_motor\_set\_position(shoulderR, 10.0); but it doesn't move at all. Am I incorrectly calling the motor? If so, what is the correct way?

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 06/04/2019 15:11:39
Yes of course it is possible to control the motor individually, for this you should not use the motion or gait manager.

The code you provide seems correct, but make sur to call the wb\_robot\_step function in your main loop.

Here is a simple example of position feedback and position control with this robot: [https://github.com/omichel/webots/blob/revision/projects/robots/robotis/darwin-op/controllers/symmetry/Symmetry.cpp](https://github.com/omichel/webots/blob/revision/projects/robots/robotis/darwin-op/controllers/symmetry/Symmetry.cpp)

##### Mi 06/04/2019 15:59:29
Hello

Is it possible to control a robot through an external python script?

For example my script runs on my terminal and Webots responds to commands.

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 06/05/2019 05:35:43
HI `@Mi` , this is currently not possible,  Webots is responsible to launch the Webots script for now.

However, we did implement a new mechanism allowing you to launch yourself the controller in our development version, here is the documentation: 

[https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/running-extern-robot-controllers?version=develop](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/running-extern-robot-controllers?version=develop)

We will release a new version of Webots including this functionnality in ~1month.

In the meantime, if you need this feature you can recompile Webots yourself from the 'develop' branch, here are the instructions:

[https://github.com/omichel/webots/wiki#installation-of-the-webots-development-environment](https://github.com/omichel/webots/wiki#installation-of-the-webots-development-environment)

##### JustDN 06/05/2019 14:45:48
I'm trying to set a motor position for my OP2 code to infinity with "shoulderl->setPosition(INFINITY);" but when running the code, I came across the error " 'INFINITY' was not declared in this scope" does that mean that the OP2 is unable to do that?

##### Fabien Rohrer [Moderator] 06/05/2019 14:46:26
Hi


No, it means that the INFINITY macro is not declared here. (INFINITY is a macro defined in the C header "math.h")


in C++, you should write infinity this way:


std::numeric\_limits<double>::infinity


[https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/types/numeric\_limits/infinity](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/types/numeric_limits/infinity)


This deserves to include: "#include <limits>" too


There is a C++ note about this, in our documentation: [https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/motor#motor-functions](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/motor#motor-functions)

##### JustDN 06/05/2019 14:49:45
Thank you for the help! `@Fabien Rohrer`


HI, I'm having trouble having consecutive actions to occur. I wanted my robot to raise its arm and then go back down. When programming the motors to do the actions, the arm down action overrided the arm up action so only the arm down action occured. I tried adding a sleep delay in between each action but that delay took precedent over the actions, so there is a delay at the start of the program and then the actions occurred.

##### Vinicius Aguiar 06/05/2019 16:26:20
Hello, could you guys help me?



I'm programming a robotic manipulator and wanted to move the base of it by 90 ¬∞ positive and then by 90 ¬∞ negative when I perform the print of each step of the position occurs as expected, but in the simulation it only performed the negative part, ignoring the first position .


```
####This is my code in python####

from controller import Robot, Motor
import numpy as np
import math

TIME_STEP = 64

robot = Robot()
joint1 = Motor('joint_1')


def position(signal):

   target = joint1.getTargetPosition()

   while signal != target:

       target = joint1.getTargetPosition()
       signal = round(signal,2)
       target = round(target,2)

       if signal > target:
          for i in np.arange(target,signal,0.01):
             joint1.setPosition(i)
             print("position",i)

       elif signal < target:
           for i in np.arange(target,signal,-0.01):
               joint1.setPosition(i)
               print("position",i)

while robot.step(TIME_STEP) != -1:
   # first position
   position(1.57)
   # second position
   position(-1.57)
```

##### Stefania Pedrazzi [cyberbotics] 06/06/2019 06:01:11
`@JustDN` int the main simulation loop `while(wb_robot_ste()){}` you have to check using a PositionSensor that the first action terminated before starting the next one. You can see an example in the `robots/neuronics/ipr/worlds/ipr_collaboration.wbt` simulation. The `positionReached()` function is defined in the `robots/neuronics/ipr/libraries/ipr/IPR.cpp` source file


`@Vinicius Aguiar` your issue is very similar to the one of `@JustDN`: after setting the first position you have to wait until the position is reached before requesting the second position.

To check if the position is reached you can the PositionSensor device. The  `robots/neuronics/ipr/worlds/ipr_collaboration.wbt` I mentioned in the previous comment shows a simple way to execute consecutive actions with robotic manipulators.

##### Karl 06/06/2019 10:14:29

and an entry\_points.cpp where I implement them...

##### Fabien Rohrer [Moderator] 06/06/2019 10:14:55

Probably that the argument of wbr\_init() is missing:

Is there a way model gear reduction on webots

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 06/06/2019 12:52:46
Hi `@bhsapiens91` unfortunately we do not have any gear reduction node in Webots yet (but it should be feasible to implement it because our physics engine does support it). However if you are using the Car node there is a gear field.

##### bhsapiens91 06/06/2019 12:54:40
I have a servo Robotic arm which has a 380:1 reduction at it's joint. Trying to make a realistic model of the hardware in simulation


Without reduction it behaves like a direct drive


Which is not the case in real world

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 06/06/2019 12:55:45
The simplest solution would be to emulate this reduction at the controller level.

Or can implement a Gear node (and we can help you of course)

##### bhsapiens91 06/06/2019 12:56:11

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 06/06/2019 12:57:40
Ok, perfect, if you need help I would suggest to present a design (where to put this node, which fields, etc...) and present it on our Github in an issue so that we can already give you feedback.

##### JustDN 06/06/2019 15:15:09
I was looking at the IPR code and I am confused on now to declare the !positionReached function. Also, would I also have to initialize my position sensors for it to work?


I'm also trying to follow the code using "mTimeStep = getBasicTimeStep();" and  "while (!positionReached(shoulderr, 1))

   step(basicTimeStep());" and I was told that I they weren't declared in the scope, I looked at the simulation code and didn't find any of the declarations, what is the right way to do the declarations in C++?

##### Fabien Rohrer [Moderator] 06/06/2019 15:39:52
Do you speak about this controller? [https://github.com/omichel/webots/blob/master/projects/robots/neuronics/ipr/controllers/ipr1\_collaboration/ipr1\_collaboration.cpp](https://github.com/omichel/webots/blob/master/projects/robots/neuronics/ipr/controllers/ipr1_collaboration/ipr1_collaboration.cpp)


This function is declared in this small library helping to control the IPR: [https://github.com/omichel/webots/blob/master/projects/robots/neuronics/ipr/libraries/ipr/IPR.hpp](https://github.com/omichel/webots/blob/master/projects/robots/neuronics/ipr/libraries/ipr/IPR.hpp)


Position sensors are enabled in this library, in the IPR constructor: [https://github.com/omichel/webots/blob/master/projects/robots/neuronics/ipr/libraries/ipr/IPR.cpp#L81](https://github.com/omichel/webots/blob/master/projects/robots/neuronics/ipr/libraries/ipr/IPR.cpp#L81)


The IPR class inherits of the Robot class.


Here is the simplest example of initialization: [https://github.com/omichel/webots/blob/master/projects/robots/neuronics/ipr/controllers/ipr\_cube/ipr\_cube.cpp](https://github.com/omichel/webots/blob/master/projects/robots/neuronics/ipr/controllers/ipr_cube/ipr_cube.cpp)

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 06/07/2019 06:34:06
`@Mi` si esta posible, pero solo podemos aydarle en ingl√©s...

In which kind of environment would you like to run Webots? The simplest option is to use the '--batch' option when starting Webots, this will prevent Webots from opening any blocking pop-up window, and the '--minimize' option to launch Webots in minimized mode. However you still need to have a valid OpenGl context, if this is problematic there are some way to go around this, let us know.

Hi `@BlackPearl` there is no tutorial specific to the Nao robot in Java, however, our Java tutorial are valid for the Nao robot too: [https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/tutorial-1-your-first-simulation-in-webots-20-minutes?tab=java](https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/tutorial-1-your-first-simulation-in-webots-20-minutes?tab=java)

`@David Mansolino` ok thank you anyways. Will Document it then

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 06/11/2019 10:31:58
HI `@nisuunn`, you can use the Supervisor APi to get the location and orientation of the other robot and assign it to the new one:

[https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/supervisor#wb\_supervisor\_node\_get\_position](https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/supervisor#wb_supervisor_node_get_position)

[https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/supervisor#wb\_supervisor\_field\_get\_sf\_vec3f](https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/supervisor#wb_supervisor_field_get_sf_vec3f)


`@BlackPearl`, you're welcome

##### nisuunn 06/11/2019 10:34:17
Could I also just get the original robot's centre of mass field with supervisor and apply that centre of mass to the new spawned robot?

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 06/11/2019 11:01:07
Yes, that's also a possibility. you can set the correct value for the 'translation and rotation' fields directly when you import the robot.

##### nisuunn 06/11/2019 11:02:47
how does that affect relative COM, isn't relative COM indpendent of translation and orientation/rotation of the robot?

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 06/11/2019 11:04:30
The COM depends on the origin of the robot (i.e. it's translation) and the gonfiguration of its joints.

##### nisuunn 06/11/2019 12:07:19
okay, thanks!

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 06/11/2019 12:07:35
You're welcome

##### nisuunn 06/11/2019 12:19:29
Is there any specific reason as to why the centre of mass changes when a copy of a robot is created? (the COM changes such that rather than the COM being in the ~centre of the robot, the COM shifts to the front of the robot, such that it is highly unstable compared to the original robot. )

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 06/11/2019 12:59:49
It should not, the COM should be at the same position (respectively to the robot) than the one of the other robot. Did you save the simulation after it has run? Do you have a simple procedure to reproduce the issue?

##### nisuunn 06/11/2019 13:03:20
I haven't saved after running sim.


I don't really have any simple reproduction procedure


The main body of the robot, has the coord axes at one of the 4 corners of the body, rather than the center of the body.


Could this have an influence?


even if this doesn't have an effect on the original robot's COM?

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 06/11/2019 13:05:21
It should not cause any problem


Can you send a screen shot of the 2 robot with the different COM ?

dw about it


yeah I am using a VM


and it has trouble allocating resources for extracting for some reason

##### Fabien Rohrer [Moderator] 06/11/2019 14:31:51
You should retry to download and extract the archive.


.. and use this command: [https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/installation-procedure#from-the-tarball-package](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/installation-procedure#from-the-tarball-package)

##### Deleted User 06/11/2019 14:33:22
is there anyway to do portable in windows


in that VM I had only 3 cores


in windows I can allocate around 16


so should be fine


because its a vm its limited for heavy tasks

##### Fabien Rohrer [Moderator] 06/11/2019 14:34:27
cores are a thing, but support of hardware acceleration is more important to run Webots smoothly.


running Webots natively is highly recommended.


(but I run Webots everyday on VMWare fusion, with 4 cores üòâ )

##### Deleted User 06/11/2019 14:36:57
yeah I am using vmware

<@302517149359144962> Ok it seems to work better on Windows then ^^ The warning is "regular": it appears when Webots detects low-end GPU (including VM).


`@El_Samu_El` getFromDev does not exits.


is it a typo?

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 06/12/2019 06:37:16
@THO, this is not currently possible, however, we have a prototype of such feature, see this video at 1:09:

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?time\_continue=1&v=O7U3sX\_ubGc](https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=1&v=O7U3sX_ubGc)

If you want we can either send you a quote for finalizing and integrating this prototype into Webots for you or you can do it by yourself directly (we can guide you if you open a pull request on our Github repository).


`@JustDN`, yes we have an example of controller using OpenCV, please see 'projects/samples/robotbenchmark/visual\_tracking'.

But more generally speaking, you can link your controller with any third party library installed on your computer, here is an explanation for C/C++: [https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/using-webots-makefiles#adding-an-external-library-ccp](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/using-webots-makefiles#adding-an-external-library-ccp)

whats the correct way of declaring a gps handle?

##### Stefania Pedrazzi [cyberbotics] 06/13/2019 06:03:47
Hi `@nisuunn` , you have to use the Robot function `Robot.getGPS("gps")`. Please refer to the documentation [https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/robot?tab=python#getgps](https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/robot?tab=python#getgps).

i want to know the name of lidar sensor that used webot's sample lidar


if you guys know about it, tell me please

##### Fabien Rohrer [Moderator] 06/13/2019 11:21:45
Hi,


You can know the device names by opening the robot window (double click on the robot).


In your case, it's probably "lidar", the default value of the Lidar.name field.


Do you speak about lidar.wbt?

##### nick\_robot\_maker 06/13/2019 11:23:30
yes


the world


it is named lidar.wbt


and i try to know what is lidar sensor's model name that using this sample world

##### Fabien Rohrer [Moderator] 06/13/2019 11:25:43
Ok, it's simply a generic lidar, no model

##### nick\_robot\_maker 06/13/2019 11:27:04
is it? thank a lot. but i found the officail homepage and find ladar sensor's models.

Just look at the robot definition (the red rectangle in my screenshot).


It's directly a Lidar node.


The non-default parameters are shown in green.

##### nick\_robot\_maker 06/13/2019 11:30:54

you means this lidar sensor is just default sensor?

##### Fabien Rohrer [Moderator] 06/13/2019 11:52:22
You could simply copy the Lidar node, and paste it in another robot.


Yes, this demo is very basic. It shows how to use the Lidar node.


If you would like to use an existing Lidar model, just add a node to your robot, from the GUI, you can select a Sick, etc.


But every existing lidar model (like Sick) are in fact a Lidar node.

##### nick\_robot\_maker 06/13/2019 12:26:09
very good. thank you so much. could you show me how to  choose the sensor to add robot please? i can't find any sensor.

##### Fabien Rohrer [Moderator] 06/13/2019 12:28:02
Just select your Robot.children field, and click on the "+" button, the sick sensors are available in the "Add node dialog..."

Hey guys, is there a possibility to pass arguments to the controller when starting webots from the command line?

##### Fabien Rohrer [Moderator] 06/13/2019 14:29:07
Hi


Yes sure, see Robot.controllerArgs field

##### El\_Samu\_El 06/13/2019 14:29:38
Ah, is that also possible with python?

##### Fabien Rohrer [Moderator] 06/13/2019 14:29:45
yes


you can retrieve them with sys.argv in the controller

##### El\_Samu\_El 06/13/2019 14:30:16
okay, I'll have a look. Thanks again Fabien !


Ah but as I understand this it just get's arguments from the .wbt file

##### Fabien Rohrer [Moderator] 06/13/2019 14:34:21
üòÉ I was sure of this

##### El\_Samu\_El 06/13/2019 14:34:36
or does it also work in some way like "webots --mode=fast "example.wbt" "controllerArg"

##### Fabien Rohrer [Moderator] 06/13/2019 14:34:51
No, you can't pass arguments like this.


We assume you master your environment when launching Webots.


So you can for example create a file before launching Webots, and read it in the controllers.


Or, to create a template.wbt, and forge it before launching Webots on it (and change controllerArgs for example)

##### El\_Samu\_El 06/13/2019 14:37:29
That's true, but if I want to startup multiple webots processes with different controllers, but the same world file?


yeah the last option you mention, was what I was also thinking

##### Fabien Rohrer [Moderator] 06/13/2019 14:40:19
With several instances, the two options above are still valid (Webots will read the state when it is launched), but in this case, you probably have to be sure that Webots read the right value by implementing a callback mechanism.


In this case, there are certainly better solutions.


For example, the script launching Webots could also have a TCP server, the Webots controllers could be TCP clients, and get the info from there. It has the advantage to be persistent (results could be sent the same way later). And it's a piece of cake to do that in Python üòÉ


Does this make sense for your expectations?

##### El\_Samu\_El 06/13/2019 14:49:04
I made that TCP server already, but there were some issues with it.

##### Fabien Rohrer [Moderator] 06/13/2019 14:49:27
It's a good starting point for sure

##### El\_Samu\_El 06/13/2019 14:49:41
So I was trying to workaround this by simply starting several processes and restarting them as often as it is written in a file


But I need to start these processes sometimes with different configurations, thus the controller argument.

##### Fabien Rohrer [Moderator] 06/13/2019 14:50:42
Ok


then probably the template thing is the best

##### El\_Samu\_El 06/13/2019 14:51:10
would you use the selector module for TCP in python?

##### Fabien Rohrer [Moderator] 06/13/2019 14:51:24
you could forge a world with a different name for each instance.


I'm not sure exactly about how to implement the TCP client-server, sorry.

##### El\_Samu\_El 06/13/2019 14:54:08
Okay, yeah I am new to networking and related stuff in general.  But gave it anyway a try. It's not that easy I think. (For someone with experience it probably is)


Thanks for your help once again!

##### nisuunn 06/14/2019 13:31:06
Hi, my robot has springs around its feet or knees. They work as expected, except for when the robot is upside down. When the robot is upside down, for some reason the springs move in the opposite direction that you'd expect, why is that?


The spring is a slider joint


with a spring constant

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 06/14/2019 13:32:45
Hi, could that be because of gravity?

##### nisuunn 06/14/2019 13:33:23
Perhaps, but if the robot is not upside down, then the springs manage to support the mass of the robot, hence I would expect the springs to not be pulled down by only gravity when upside down

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 06/14/2019 13:33:27
Did you try to play with the WorldInfo.gravity value to see how it affects the behavior?

##### nisuunn 06/14/2019 13:33:36
Ill try it out


lowering the gravity to around 3 still pulls the springs down when upside down


or down to 0.5 as well

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 06/14/2019 13:37:05
What about reversing the gravity e.g, +9.81 instead of -9.81?


And setting the gravity to 0?

##### nisuunn 06/14/2019 13:40:01
gravity 0: still the same


at +9.81  springs behave as expected i think


even when upside down

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 06/14/2019 13:41:15
Ok, that means it is probably not related with gravity...


Can you share a movie showing the problem you have?

Here is

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 06/14/2019 13:56:57
Thank you. However, it is not very clear to me what the problem is. Could you create a minimalist simulation (just one joint) showing the problem?

##### nisuunn 06/14/2019 13:58:22
In the video: when the robot is the correct way up, its upper legs are supported by the springs that connect the feet and upper leg


however when upside down, as can be see from the video, the springs compress


and allow the feet to drop down


but i would expect the springs to support the feet when upside down, as they were able to support the entire robot's mass when the correct way up

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 06/14/2019 14:01:02
I see, but it would be interesting to see if you can reproduce the same problem with a single hinge joint which has the same spring property.

##### nisuunn 06/14/2019 14:01:27
do you mean with a single slider joint, rather than hinge?

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 06/14/2019 14:03:13
Yes.

##### nisuunn 06/14/2019 14:30:54
I'm unable to do it, but it's no issue in my case so it's okay.


In the simpler case I tried it in, the spring behaved as expected I think


even when upside down

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 06/14/2019 14:32:22
So, you should probably try to complexify your simple example until you get this supposedly wrong behavior and you will likely find the culprit...

##### nisuunn 06/14/2019 14:32:39

Hi, i have a problem running webots in the windows subsystem for linux:

After starting webots, the gui is shown for part of a second. webots crashed after that with the error:

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 06/17/2019 06:27:04
`@MohamedSabry` Which version of Webots are you using? As Webots is now open-source you should not have any problem with licenses if you use the latest one.


`@sai` No this is unfortunately not possible. Howver, you can encapsulate all your objects in a PROTO file (in which you can use our template engine) to do this: [https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/proto](https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/proto)

Alternatively you can use a Supervisor to change the position of the objects at first step (or any other step): [https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/supervisor](https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/supervisor)


`@TH0` wouldn't it be simpler to use the Windows version of Webots directly if you are on Windows?

##### MohamedSabry 06/17/2019 07:02:33
`@David Mansolino` Yes I realized that, but when I installed the latest version, it always crashes even though I updated my graphics drives and made sure to use my "Nvidia Geforce 840M" as the graphics card responsible for the running of the application, so what should I do?

`@David Mansolino`  Our Robot Controller uses Unix Domain Sockets to emulate the Lola-Interface from a Softbank Nao V6, so it does not work on Windows.

I ask the question about WSL because we also tested Gazebo and it works without problems in WSL and we wonder that webots doesnt and hope it's maybe only a small fix needed.

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 06/17/2019 11:52:32
`@Deleted User` Webots can probably work in WSL too (if I remember correctly other users have been able to let it work) but it might be tricky to setup. Won't it be simpler to run it directly under Linux in that case ?

##### TH0 06/17/2019 13:17:49
i know what you mean and it's already working in native linux but some of our team members do not use linux as the native OS. So the idea was to "simply" run webots under WSL for development independent from the native OS.

you say: "other users have been able to let it work". do you know who or where to find the tricks for the setup? üòÉ

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 06/17/2019 13:29:38

After a number of iterations (about 120 episodes,with 800 robot steps each) the Thymio2 is literaly falling apart. I can see that gradually the wheels of the robot are starting to stick out of the body more and more,until it eventually falls apart and the physics stop making sense. I am reseting the physics in each  step but doesn't seem to change anything. What could be the problem? Could it be that the robot is "breaking" due to the colision happening during the training? And if so,how can i stop that from happening?

Hi `@DimitrisK`, that is indeed possible that very small physic errors accumulate over the iterations and can cause problems after a high number of iterations.

To work around the issue, you can revert the simulation from your supervisor controller or if you don't want your supervisor controller to restart, you can, after a defined number of iterations (e.g. 50) remove and re-import the Thymio2 robot in the simulation, this way you will have a 'brand new robot' without any accumulated errors.

##### DimitrisK 06/18/2019 10:57:54
I though of that as a possible solution. Can you give me a hint on how tp do that? My robot is the Supervisor so i don't know if removing it could cause problems...

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 06/18/2019 10:58:48
You mean the Thmio2 robot itself is the supervisor ?

##### DimitrisK 06/18/2019 11:00:40
Yes exactly

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 06/18/2019 11:01:35
In that case the problem is not removing it, but once removed you won't be able to re-add it because you don't have any supervisor anymore...


I would recommend to split your robot and your supervisor controllers. To do so you can of course have a supervisor without any physics/shape/etc.

##### DimitrisK 06/18/2019 11:05:20
Is there an example of this somewhere? On how to use two controllers i mean

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 06/18/2019 11:06:08
This is documented here: [https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/using-numerical-optimization-methods#using-two-distinct-types-of-controllers](https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/using-numerical-optimization-methods#using-two-distinct-types-of-controllers)

##### DimitrisK 06/18/2019 11:07:06
Ok thank you very much! I 'll  make the changes in order to make this work

##### Karl 06/18/2019 11:14:10
I'm developing a remote control and wbr\_init seems to be correctly called from entry\_points . There I link the interface functions to my own (like `ri->mandatory.wbr_start = Wrapper::start;`). However, these functions never seem to be called... also, when running it in WeBots, the simulation still seems to be used. Do I have to tell WeBots to use the real-life remote control somehow? Other than setting it in the remote\_control field of course


Or is 'running the controller', as described in the remote control docs, different from 'running the simulation'?

##### Fabien Rohrer [Moderator] 06/18/2019 11:37:46
In addition to set correctly the Robot.remoteControl field (as you mention), the remote control library is used when the wb\_robot\_set\_mode(WB\_MODE\_REMOTE\_CONTROL) is explicitly called in he controller:


[https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/robot#wb\_robot\_get\_mode](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/robot#wb_robot_get_mode)


This allows to switch to the remote control library after some event, typically a GUI button

##### Karl 06/18/2019 11:40:20
Ahh right!


That was it


Thanks a lot! Perhaps it would be good to add that to the remote control docs

##### Fabien Rohrer [Moderator] 06/18/2019 11:42:27
Do you think the references to wb\_robot\_set\_mode in the following page are not enough? [https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/controller-plugin](https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/controller-plugin)


If not, I can improve it right now

##### Karl 06/18/2019 11:54:00
I think it would be helpful to mention the WB\_MODE\_REMOTE\_CONTROL argument


You're right, it should be possible to figure it out as it is, but I think we would've had an easier time with that mention

##### Fabien Rohrer [Moderator] 06/18/2019 11:55:09

I'm not really understanding this error code. Isn't the first argument here "self" and thus a Supervisor. My class is inheriting SV. Why the type error?

##### Fabien Rohrer [Moderator] 06/18/2019 12:07:25
`@Karl` ok, it will be released with the new release, coming soon.


`@El_Samu_El` The error is more related with the argument passed to getFromDef


A Python String is expected, and something else is given


Could you "print(n)" just before line 26? This should be a string, but it is certainly not.

##### El\_Samu\_El 06/18/2019 12:17:39
yeah it is a string


this error does not happen when I create a supervisor instance and then use this one to call the method

##### Fabien Rohrer [Moderator] 06/18/2019 12:18:18
oh sorry, I'm maybe wrong

##### El\_Samu\_El 06/18/2019 12:18:20
can't share the picture right now in discord


but I printed it

##### Fabien Rohrer [Moderator] 06/18/2019 12:19:14
you're right, it's an issue with the Supervisor class

##### El\_Samu\_El 06/18/2019 12:19:18
I can get around this error by just creating a single supervisor instance, but I wonder why inheritance does not work.


Maybe cause the python api asserts that the class name is correct

##### Fabien Rohrer [Moderator] 06/18/2019 12:20:03
Is the Supervisor constructor correctly called?


The \_\_init\_\_ deserve certaily a call to the super() function:


Add "super().\_\_init\_\_()" on the first line of the "\_\_init\_\_" cfunction content.


This is a Python 3 statement.


In Python 2 it's: "Robot\_Environment.\_\_init\_\_(self)"

##### El\_Samu\_El 06/18/2019 12:28:27

##### Akash 06/19/2019 00:05:05
Can get a proper lookup table chart values for 'Compass'. The lookup table I have made it is having three vector values -1, 0 and 1, and three response values 0, 90 and 180. When I rotate the bot on 0, 90 or 180 degree the function compass.getValues() giving proper response/output values of 0, 90 and 180 respectively, but while I rotate it to any other degree output values are not as expected like on 45 degree the function is giving a output value of 23. Is there any proper lookup table chart by which  on 45 degree a output value of 45 can be achieved?

##### Stefania Pedrazzi [cyberbotics] 06/19/2019 06:29:03
`@Akash` the Compass returned value is the direction of virtual north so you cannot perform the conversion directly using the lookup table becaue the returned value for a 45 degrees rotations is [0.7075, 0, 0.7075]. Instead you should compute the angle in your controller using the `get_bearing_in_degress()` function described in the Reference Manual:  [https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/compass#wb\_compass\_get\_values](https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/compass#wb_compass_get_values)

##### Akash 06/19/2019 10:44:01
In the function get\_bearing\_in\_degress() there is a variable M\_PI. This variable is also used in other functions but I can find its value. What is the value of  M\_PI ?

It's a standard C constant defined in math.h

##### Akash 06/19/2019 11:09:59
I wrote the function get\_bearing\_in\_degrees() in  python, set the vaule of M\_IP to 3.14...6, and the lookup table I have made it is having three vector values -1, 0 and 1, and three response values 0, 90 and 180 respectively. The output values are not proper it is varying from 270 to 360 only. Any solution so that I can get proper values in the output, like on 56 degree the output will be 56 or on 219 degree output will be 219?

##### Fabien Rohrer [Moderator] 06/19/2019 11:59:57
It's probably due to your algorithm.


Did you thought to use a InerialUnit instead of a Compass? It can return the roll/pitch/yaw, yaw is basically what you need.

Good evening everyone! I'm looking for a way to launch Webots in batch mode BUT without GUI. Unfortunately I've been unable to find any clue throughout the online documentation. So I was wondering if there is any way to genuinely achieve it, even with a console trick.



PS: I hope to be in the right section

Hi,


Try "./webots --minimize --batch --stdout --stderr"

I already took a look into the cli options but none of them has the wanted effect (that is without having the Webots icon popping up on the application bar), sadly.



For now I'll stick with redirecting stdout and stderr to console as you have suggested!

##### nisuunn 06/19/2019 14:30:55
Hi, I am trying to use an emitter to send data to a physics plugin. (controller is in python).


Right now im trying out:


structPacked = struct.pack(b"chd")

    emit1.send(structPacked)


in the controller


and


int* emitter;

   int size;

   emitter = (int*) dWebotsReceive(&size);

   dWebotsConsolePrintf("%s\n", emitter[0]);


in the physics plugin's webots\_physics\_step loop


This crashes my webots


What is the correct way of sending a message?

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 06/19/2019 14:33:06
You should send plain text from your Python controller and read plain text from the physics plugin.


int *emitter; seems wrong


It should be "char *emitter\_data"


dWebotsConsolePrintf("%s\n", emitter[0]); seems wrong

##### nisuunn 06/19/2019 14:34:02
but if i was sending int instead of char, then I'd still use int?

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 06/19/2019 14:34:03
it should be dWebotsConsolePrintf("%s\n", emitter\_data);


Your printf is wrong anyhow, it should be:


dWebotsConsolePrintf("%d\n", emitter[0]);


if passing a int *


(note %d instead of %s)


This is a basic C programming question and is not related with Webots.

##### nisuunn 06/19/2019 14:37:08

Hello, is it possible to set the boundingobject mass to 0?


I would liek to use an IMU


for which I need to define a boundingobject


but this boundingobject adds the mass of the boundingobject to my robot


which is undesirable


is there any way around this?

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 06/20/2019 15:40:13
If you want to set both the mass and desity to 0, you simply have to remove the 'Physics' node.

##### nisuunn 06/20/2019 15:41:02
The documentation says that no physics node is needed for bumper type of touchsensor


im sorry i meatn touch sensor


trying to use touchsensor and set its boundingobject

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 06/20/2019 15:41:25
Ah ok, for the touchsensors it is indeed different

##### nisuunn 06/20/2019 15:42:02
when I have touchsesnor of  type bumper without physics defined


then my robot's physics behaves weirdly,


when i add physics node robots physics is normal


but the mass of boundingobject gets added to robots mass

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 06/20/2019 15:42:40
You obviously need to define the boundingObject of the touchsensor to define the detection area, but you should be able to not add any physics


let me try


I just tried and it is working fine, you can define the BoundingObject of the touchSensor without defining any Physics node. What is the weird behavior you observe? Did you make sur the bounding object of the sensors is not touching anythin elese than the robot itself (the collision with this bounding object will still be taken into account).

##### nisuunn 06/20/2019 15:49:12
the boundingobject touches the robots legs, is that okay?


the sensor is attached to the torso


a child of torso

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 06/20/2019 15:49:32
did you enable the robot.selfCollision ?

##### nisuunn 06/20/2019 15:50:02
the robots selfCollision field in the node tree is set to true

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 06/20/2019 15:50:41
In that cas that can indeed be a problem, because the legs might collide with the touchsensors and prevent them from moving

##### nisuunn 06/20/2019 15:50:58
so selfcollision to false would help?

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 06/20/2019 15:51:09
Probably, I would suggest to try

##### nisuunn 06/20/2019 15:51:54

##### nisuunn 06/21/2019 10:30:13
Hi, I'd like to send messages using an emitter from a controller to a physics plugin. (The controller is in python).

I can send strings no problem

But I would like to send floats.

In the controller I do: 

msg = struct.pack("f", xVal) # where xVal is a float

emit1.send(msg)

In the physics plugin I have:


const float *emitterData = (float*) dWebotsReceive(&size); // receiving floats?

   dWebotsConsolePrintf("%d\n", emitterData[0]);


Running this crashes


How to correctly receive floats?

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 06/21/2019 10:35:15
I believe Python don't have IEEE float, but only double. Replace const float emitterData = (float) with const double *emitterData = (double *)and replace %d with %g or %f in your printf...

##### nisuunn 06/21/2019 10:35:32
Thank you, I will try that

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 06/21/2019 10:36:16
If you can't achieve this, you can always pass strings and convert them to float using sscanf(s, "%f", &value);

##### nisuunn 06/21/2019 10:37:22
Okay, thanks for your time.


I still crash


the python controller is:


b = repr(msg).encode()

        print("b: " + str(b))

        emit1.send(b)


the c++ physics plugin is


std::string *emitterData;

int size; emitterData = (std::string*) dWebotsReceive(&size);

   const char *cstr = emitterData->c\_str();

   float target;

   sscanf(cstr, "%f", &target); // convert string to float

   //float aNumero=strtof((*emitterData).c\_str(),0); // string to float

   //float val = std::stof(*emitterData); 

   //HERE

   dWebotsConsolePrintf("%f\n", target);


ill send physics plugin again


std::string *emitterData;

std::string *emitterData;

emitterData = (std::string*) dWebotsReceive(&size);

const char *cstr = emitterData->c\_str();

float target;

 sscanf(cstr, "%f", &target); // convert string to float

dWebotsConsolePrintf("%f\n", target);


I tried your earlier suggestion of receiving doubles instead because python doesn't have float.


I couldn't get that to work


so I tried to use sscanf to convert the controllers sent string to float


the second line in the physics plugin "std::string emitterData" can be ignored

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 06/21/2019 12:22:34

##### nisuunn 06/21/2019 12:30:44
ah yeah the 1st line was char *emitterData; , the copy didn't work properly for some reason.

##### El\_Samu\_El 06/21/2019 12:30:48

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 06/21/2019 12:31:59
`@El_Samu_El`: in that case, you should probably recompile Webots from the sources and disable the sound functions (initialization, etc.).


(or ignore the warnings, or install a virtual sound card on your VM).

##### El\_Samu\_El 06/21/2019 12:35:26
how do I ignore the warnings that webots outputs on starting from the terminal?

##### TH0 06/21/2019 15:54:36
Hi, is there some helper function to calculate the SFRotation values?

for example: i just like to rotate a Nao (in the soccer simulation) by a supervisor program by alpha degrees keeping the feet on the ground. 

I thought just to set the rotation vector to the y axis (perpendicular to the field) and than simply adjust the angle. but that does not work.



In contrast the values for such a SFRotation are strange:

Looking towards first goal from center circle: SFRotation = 1   0  0  -1.5708

Looking to other side towards opposite goal from center circle (turn by 180 degrees): 0   0.7071    0.7071    -3.1415


i guess the coordinate system from the nao proto itself is rotated and that caused the strange values. but maybe you know a simple work around for that

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 06/21/2019 16:10:01
`@TH0`  , you are completely right, the coordinate system of the nao is not perfect as it is by default rotated, you should therefore combine your rotation with the '1   0  0  -1.5708' rotation, we do not provide any tool to do this, but I am sure you can find some nice libraries that do this.

##### bing feng 06/26/2019 12:37:19
oh wow u guys have atlas!

##### Fabien Rohrer [Moderator] 06/26/2019 12:39:03
If you have good knowledge in Blender, you could start by studying the arm example. If the node hierarchy is well done in Blender, it's simple to export the Blender model to Webots.

##### bing feng 06/26/2019 12:41:35
to moves the parts do i need to add things like bones and rigid body things.....


cuz i have no experience in those

##### Fabien Rohrer [Moderator] 06/26/2019 12:43:58
No, the exporter is currently only supporting solids. You need to create a node per degree of freedom (aka DOF, aka Solid), and create  a tree hierarchy in blender. The relative center of the nodes will used as joint pivot center. The rotation axis can be set in the JSON file.


If you open these files, you will certainly understand what I mean: [https://github.com/omichel/blender-webots-exporter/tree/master/examples/abb](https://github.com/omichel/blender-webots-exporter/tree/master/examples/abb)

##### bing feng 06/26/2019 12:53:21
no i meant the thingy


hold on ill send screenshots


ok i cant find it cuz im not that good at blender (literally started this year) but do i need to rig the model in order for it to move?

##### Fabien Rohrer [Moderator] 06/26/2019 12:55:10
no rig


you need to split the object into peaces, one node per DOF

##### bing feng 06/26/2019 12:55:39
then how will i or this godly software know where to move the joints?


ah

##### Fabien Rohrer [Moderator] 06/26/2019 12:55:54
then create a node hierarchy

##### bing feng 06/26/2019 12:56:11
yeye


im hoping this file doesnt have a virus or malware (not an insult) cuz windows defender marked it as dangerous

##### Fabien Rohrer [Moderator] 06/26/2019 12:57:09
we guarantee it's clean


please take a look at the node hierachy, and the object center.

##### bing feng 06/26/2019 12:59:28
oh wow


which programming language does webot use?


cuz im tryna build a robot using arduino and a raspberry pi


and sorta have a little bit of python and C

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 06/26/2019 13:10:36
Webots is compatible with C, C++, Matlab, Java, Python and ROS.

##### Emil Enchev 06/27/2019 07:20:33
Look my first place simulation [https://robotbenchmark.net/benchmark/humanoid\_sprint/](https://robotbenchmark.net/benchmark/humanoid_sprint/) . I'm new in Webots and I think is this good environment for making


walking simulations at all?

##### bing feng 06/27/2019 07:21:36
nice


im new too

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 06/27/2019 07:22:41
Hi, congrats for your ranking !

Yes, many researcher are using Webots for walk simulation. Do you have any problem or specific need for your simulations?

##### Emil Enchev 06/27/2019 07:23:57
Obviously some developer don't think about side resistance as a factor.  Run first place [https://robotbenchmark.net/benchmark/humanoid\_sprint/](https://robotbenchmark.net/benchmark/humanoid_sprint/) and answer me is this simulation behavior normal for Webots?

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 06/27/2019 07:23:59
In your case it seems you are exploiting some physical instabilites of the physics engine of Webots....

##### Emil Enchev 06/27/2019 07:25:03
But this is important for me, because I will work on walking-running stabilization programming

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 06/27/2019 07:25:12
Indeed the friction betwwen the feets and the ground seems badly calibrated in this simulation...


But as described in the doc, it is possible to faithfully calibrate the contact properties: [https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/contactproperties](https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/contactproperties)

##### Emil Enchev 06/27/2019 07:28:11
Ok David, obviously I first must read documentation and next to complain from bugs. Thanks

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 06/27/2019 07:29:12
You're welcome, no problem, it is always good to have feedback, we will improve the calibration of the contact for this benchmark for a future version.

##### Emil Enchev 06/27/2019 09:21:40
Why you don't buy some real robots for online testing by your Webots users?

##### Fabien Rohrer [Moderator] 06/27/2019 09:22:33
We do, we have a collection of robots here üòÉ

##### Emil Enchev 06/27/2019 09:23:30
I talk about real robots, not simulation of real robots.

##### Fabien Rohrer [Moderator] 06/27/2019 09:24:10
We have serveral real robots in our office, the Nao, Robotis OP, several small wheeled robots, etc.


What do you have in mind?

##### bing feng 06/27/2019 09:24:54
are the robots available to the public?

##### Emil Enchev 06/27/2019 09:25:07
Why you don't organize some RENT services. Pay for time test small tax

##### bing feng 06/27/2019 09:25:17
i would pay!

##### Emil Enchev 06/27/2019 09:25:36
Euro 8000 for now is not what many users can afford


for NAO i mean

##### bing feng 06/27/2019 09:26:21
if ur talking abt me i meant the rent services


i meant that i would be happy to pay a small fee for testing

##### Fabien Rohrer [Moderator] 06/27/2019 09:26:34
This is for sure a good idea. But I fear that the price for a rent of a 8000 euros robot would be prohibitive too.

##### bing feng 06/27/2019 09:27:26
what about like online physical testing.... :/


like add a camera etc.

##### Fabien Rohrer [Moderator] 06/27/2019 09:28:03
Sending a robot worldwide is costly, robots are breakable (so a QA service should be created), etc.


Maybe that the robot manufactors would be interested by such concept.


Having an online testing service seems more doable.

##### bing feng 06/27/2019 09:28:47
its like paying someone to 3d print something


(sort of....)

##### Emil Enchev 06/27/2019 09:29:40
1 Euro on Hour, 24 on day,  8760 euro for year. Of course, if NAO withstand 1 year üòÉ

##### bing feng 06/27/2019 09:30:03
thats 760 euros profit

##### Fabien Rohrer [Moderator] 06/27/2019 09:30:25
The cost of the service should be evaluated too, there are not only benefits haha

##### bing feng 06/27/2019 09:30:25
but i dont think it can withstand 24/7/365

##### Fabien Rohrer [Moderator] 06/27/2019 09:31:07
So would you pay 3000$ for a rent of 3 months?

##### bing feng 06/27/2019 09:31:17
well i wont rent for 3 months.....


probs like 3 hours


5


robotics is my hobby.....

##### Emil Enchev 06/27/2019 09:32:00
SoftBank are very deluded.  They have to lower prices or put them on cheap rent online


I can make better software from Boston Dynamic üòâ

##### bing feng 06/27/2019 09:32:43
u work at boston dynamics?

##### Emil Enchev 06/27/2019 09:33:08
Not, they are amateurs. Years and achieved nothing

##### Fabien Rohrer [Moderator] 06/27/2019 09:33:18
Haha

##### bing feng 06/27/2019 09:33:21
meh


they achieved SOME things

##### Emil Enchev 06/27/2019 09:33:33
Nothing

##### bing feng 06/27/2019 09:33:37
like have u seen atlas doing the frickin back flip


although there isnt any real life situation that could help society by doing a backflip

##### Emil Enchev 06/27/2019 09:34:18
This carap stabilization system they have, can be build very easy with self adapting software


they do with with many tests

##### bing feng 06/27/2019 09:34:37
meh


im tryna build a bipedal robot but i have no idea how to  stabilise things

##### Emil Enchev 06/27/2019 09:35:05
I can make NAO to do Backflip if it have power for it

##### bing feng 06/27/2019 09:35:06
apart from controlling each motor 1 by 1


but thats just annoying

##### Fabien Rohrer [Moderator] 06/27/2019 09:35:29
`@Emil Enchev` Are you from industry, academics or hobbyist?

##### bing feng 06/27/2019 09:35:47
i want to do it as a job but not old enough YET.... :/

##### Emil Enchev 06/27/2019 09:36:18
Not, I'm not.

##### bing feng 06/27/2019 09:36:32
so hobbyist?

##### Emil Enchev 06/27/2019 09:38:36
Do you remember the Robostadium old forum, and the most watched topic there, "to stand up the NAO from any position".

##### Fabien Rohrer [Moderator] 06/27/2019 09:39:12
Oh yes, I remember, nice to see you again üòÉ

##### bing feng 06/27/2019 09:39:29
u guys know each other.....?

##### Fabien Rohrer [Moderator] 06/27/2019 09:40:27
robotstadium was a contest we organized

##### bing feng 06/27/2019 09:40:43
ah

##### Emil Enchev 06/27/2019 09:41:40
Ooo, this time it will be more from "nice to see you".  So you think RENT will be not profitable?

##### bing feng 06/27/2019 09:42:06
well i mean if they charge 5 euros an hour


they would profit a little right?


40k euros if u run it 24/7/365


that is a lot of money

##### Fabien Rohrer [Moderator] 06/27/2019 09:42:53
this has to be thought. create a buisness model. A priori, I think it would be too expensive to work.

##### Emil Enchev 06/27/2019 09:42:56
If NAO withstand

##### bing feng 06/27/2019 09:43:03
ye tru

##### Fabien Rohrer [Moderator] 06/27/2019 09:43:06
Renting for less than a day seems impossible


due to constraints with delivery

##### bing feng 06/27/2019 09:43:37
even if its online?


like cam

##### Emil Enchev 06/27/2019 09:43:59
Why. The user can upload software to robot, and see result in real time for hour or so

##### bing feng 06/27/2019 09:44:09
ye

##### Fabien Rohrer [Moderator] 06/27/2019 09:44:10
Yes, this seems much more doable online.

##### bing feng 06/27/2019 09:44:28
but then again, their software is exactly that right?

##### Emil Enchev 06/27/2019 09:44:30
I talk only for online rent, not real

##### Fabien Rohrer [Moderator] 06/27/2019 09:44:39
I mean to have an online access to a real robot.

##### bing feng 06/27/2019 09:44:44
same, mainly cuz im scared ill break it

##### Emil Enchev 06/27/2019 09:44:46
yes

##### Fabien Rohrer [Moderator] 06/27/2019 09:45:12
I also fear that users would break robots in such system

##### bing feng 06/27/2019 09:45:21
tru

##### Fabien Rohrer [Moderator] 06/27/2019 09:45:25
the API should be very very robust

##### Emil Enchev 06/27/2019 09:45:38
break, will be include in equation and will have protect software for that purpose

##### Fabien Rohrer [Moderator] 06/27/2019 09:45:45
and this does not prevent to do heavy falls

##### Emil Enchev 06/27/2019 09:46:11
what happen with NAO in heavy falls is someone test it

##### bing feng 06/27/2019 09:46:13
im j gna continue using the software cuz its FREEEEEE

##### Fabien Rohrer [Moderator] 06/27/2019 09:46:18
hardware on such robots is unfortunately also very breakable


I had bad experiments on the robotis op

##### Emil Enchev 06/27/2019 09:46:45
how breakable do you test it

##### Fabien Rohrer [Moderator] 06/27/2019 09:46:54
a fall => the camera is broken

##### bing feng 06/27/2019 09:46:57
i mean its technically the same thing right? the software and hardware... :/

##### Fabien Rohrer [Moderator] 06/27/2019 09:47:18
a bad command => the motor overheats and is dead

##### Emil Enchev 06/27/2019 09:47:36
is there not protection mechanism?!

##### Fabien Rohrer [Moderator] 06/27/2019 09:47:39
It would be much more realist to do that on wheeled robots

##### bing feng 06/27/2019 09:47:40
oh ye did i ask already, does anyone know a good motor for robotics?


for carrying heavy objects


and DC not AC


and cheap......

##### Fabien Rohrer [Moderator] 06/27/2019 09:48:40
I'm not expert in motors, sorry.

##### bing feng 06/27/2019 09:48:47
ah


thx tho

##### Fabien Rohrer [Moderator] 06/27/2019 09:49:17
good question to ask on [https://robotics.stackexchange.com/](https://robotics.stackexchange.com/)

##### Emil Enchev 06/27/2019 09:49:18
why motor will overheats when reach its limits - it must be stop to do more load from that it can stands

##### bing feng 06/27/2019 09:49:44
well most motors have the copper wire connected to the actual line thing

##### Fabien Rohrer [Moderator] 06/27/2019 09:49:45
this is the theory haha

##### bing feng 06/27/2019 09:49:50
the center pole


and that creates friction

##### Emil Enchev 06/27/2019 09:50:01
No, I know how to protect the motors, I don't know why NAO don't have such protection?!

##### bing feng 06/27/2019 09:50:04
and sparks!


its expensive.....

##### Emil Enchev 06/27/2019 09:50:20
Are you sure, that this is only theory?!

##### bing feng 06/27/2019 09:50:22
they should take good care

##### Fabien Rohrer [Moderator] 06/27/2019 09:51:12
in my experiment, there are lot of ways to break a robotm but I'm maybe pessimist with this topic, because I come from software engineering

##### bing feng 06/27/2019 09:51:19
its like a baby, u dont force it to walk or run when its just born


or accept money to make it run or walk

##### Emil Enchev 06/27/2019 09:52:16
in my opinion he will endure and there will be a profit, even if repair is required.

##### bing feng 06/27/2019 09:52:45
can't be too safe

##### Emil Enchev 06/27/2019 09:52:48
from time to time


No need to be


Fabien, do you allow some testing on yours real NAO?


I really want to make joke with SoftBank

##### Fabien Rohrer [Moderator] 06/27/2019 09:54:52
this is very old, but I once worked on this setup, which is very close of what we are speaking about: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hH5zRy2Rb5U](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hH5zRy2Rb5U)


honestly, I have unfortunately not much time for this üò¶

##### bing feng 06/27/2019 09:56:25
u gotta take care of robots because when singularity happens everyone who didnt will die

##### Emil Enchev 06/27/2019 09:57:17
These robots are cheap, and renting will not be profitable, because there will be no interest in rent.


NAO will be other thing

##### bing feng 06/27/2019 09:58:18
u could get a NAO


and rent it out

##### Fabien Rohrer [Moderator] 06/27/2019 09:58:41
this is a good idea to think about

##### Emil Enchev 06/27/2019 09:59:35
If you make complex environment where everyone can test what he want it will be good add


Can you ask SoftBank if they want to sell several robots on cheap for this purpose üòÉ


Think the idea and try to sell it to them. After they return answer tell me what is it.

##### bing feng 06/27/2019 10:03:27
im gonna be completely honest here, I dont think softbank would allow that even if its a good idea

##### Emil Enchev 06/27/2019 10:03:43
If they refuse, we will think another option. Including making our own robot, better from NAO

##### bing feng 06/27/2019 10:03:54
then why dont you do that?

##### Emil Enchev 06/27/2019 10:03:55
Next will see, if SoftBank no interest

##### bing feng 06/27/2019 10:03:58
i mean its cheaper right?

##### Emil Enchev 06/27/2019 10:04:14
yes, cheaper and better

##### bing feng 06/27/2019 10:04:22
so why not go for that option?

##### Emil Enchev 06/27/2019 10:04:38
because it it time consuming

##### bing feng 06/27/2019 10:04:48
then ur thinking only of profit

##### Emil Enchev 06/27/2019 10:04:52
it ease to bait on NAO and SoftBank

##### bing feng 06/27/2019 10:04:54
im doing it cuz im passionate

##### Fabien Rohrer [Moderator] 06/27/2019 10:05:01
It's typically a project which would deserve to be proposed as an european project: to sell it before any trial üòÉ

Ok


I will

##### Fabien Rohrer [Moderator] 06/27/2019 10:10:35
that the creation of an online but real testing setup would be a good idea.


ok thank you


with an issue, it's simpler to be notified.

##### Emil Enchev 06/27/2019 10:27:05
Ok I write issue. You are too dubious. SoftBank Robotics will agree and will provide these robots for free.  They have no idea what they can do with them. You will see.

##### bing feng 06/27/2019 10:28:58
u want pepper?

##### Emil Enchev 06/27/2019 10:29:30
I don't understand question DarkMatter

##### bing feng 06/27/2019 10:30:26
ah nothin

##### Emil Enchev 06/27/2019 10:31:08
Ie. whether I want to make a profit out of this endeavor?


No, in the near future I will make enough profits from selling software for them.

##### bing feng 06/27/2019 10:31:51
no its just that i doubt softbank will give out their robots for free


nowadays most companies are about profit


except for this BEAUTIFUL COMPANY that made webots


they give out their code for FREEEEEE


anyways


they wont give out robots for free cuz then theyll be losing money


which is a pretty stubborn thing to do

##### Emil Enchev 06/27/2019 10:32:55
They will, or they will die in this robot endeavor like Google

##### bing feng 06/27/2019 10:33:51
google didnt fail


they are a pretty big company rn


and most companies will fail whether it be a clothing brand or a tech brand if they give stuff out for free

##### Emil Enchev 06/27/2019 10:41:57
Do you understand, these their robots not good for anything useful, just because they NOT have the appropriate software.  For example, Boston Dynamic does good hardware for robots, but software is the weak link for them. That's why Google is getting rid of them. It was a good business move from Google site. If SoftBank want to make progress they must think outside the box. For example, I will never work for them    but I'd love to make paid software for their robots, which their specialists can not. And here we fall into a dilemma. I can make wonderful software for their robots, but I can not test it. RENTING online is simple solution.

##### bing feng 06/27/2019 10:48:11
i dont mean it as an insullt


but u say Boston Dynamics has sh*tty software but its not like u can make something better


i mean they hired several people specialized in specific things and made it spending hours

##### Emil Enchev 06/27/2019 10:51:38
I'm the man who HACK Facebook. As you can see no one arrest me yet. They perfectly know who am I but can not do nothing. Do you know why?

##### bing feng 06/27/2019 10:54:17
which software u use?


*searches up online*


jkjk


i highly doubt u hacked facebook

##### Emil Enchev 06/27/2019 10:57:08
Because, 2017 year I accidentally found a problem on their site that allowed automated retrieval of phone numbers to their users with simple Python code.  I was stupid enough to inform them about it on it support. So  they fixed the problem quietly.  They did not pay me anything for that.

##### bing feng 06/27/2019 10:58:06
i still doubt u.....


can i see that python code?


its patched so no problem right?

##### Emil Enchev 06/27/2019 11:01:00
I got caught one day and found a second serious break in Facebook platform.  A month before I hacked them I told them: Now you will pay me for the first problem I discovered 2017, then for the new one. They refused because they thought I was bluffing, I hacked them. They lost billions.

##### bing feng 06/27/2019 11:01:53
so.... which software did u use?

##### Emil Enchev 06/27/2019 11:02:52
Now if they arrest me, they have to admit theirs shareholders, that they are cheap idiots and lost billions because they were not given a few tens of thousands of dollars to the man who hack them.


You can believe me or not.

##### bing feng 06/27/2019 11:04:07
i obviously dont

##### Emil Enchev 06/27/2019 11:04:10
Its your problem.


My point is. Never underestimate lone wolves. SoftBank Robotics will die if they don't open opportunity for outsiders to write software for their robots.

##### bing feng 06/27/2019 11:05:28
someone who hacked facebook and threatened them, wouldnt be stubborn enough to share that on discord, where they can have 2 life sentences for hacking and corporate espionage

##### Emil Enchev 06/27/2019 11:06:00
And ask them whey they don't arrest me üòâ

##### bing feng 06/27/2019 11:06:59
ye no i still dont believe u at all

##### Emil Enchev 06/27/2019 11:07:31
Its not matter, as I said it.


you believe me or not.

##### bing feng 06/27/2019 11:07:50

Nikunj, start with this first [https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/foreword?version=R2019b](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/foreword?version=R2019b) I'm too new and now read them.

@ Emil , thank you for the link, i have gone thro' the link earlier ....but found that already available various robot can be  simulated and analyze. please advise if any can develop own robot with 3 wheels and 4 legs type hybrid mobile robot .....please help ...advise...

##### Emil Enchev 06/27/2019 11:27:08
DarkMatter, yes I'm from Bulgaria, and No I'm not working for HP.  As I said you believe me or not, it doesn't matter at all. We will wait some times and you will see, that SoftBank will give Cyberbotics free NAO robots for online renting. Now really to stop, because we interrupt technical support here.


`@Nikunj`  , You must wait for Cyberbotics members to answer you.

##### Emil Enchev 06/27/2019 11:46:22
`@Fabien Rohrer` answer `@Nikunj`  the question, because I fill this wall with trush.


üòÉ sorry for that


And `@Fabi`en , I think that if you arrange one big room with 4-5 NAO robots. One man can maintain them and help renting people if there is some minor problems, like robot fall and stuck or something like that. As `@bing feng` propose 5 Euro on Hour will be good enough for renting people and  even money will remain for the salary of the supporting NAO's person. Everything will be fine.  First, Softbank will stretch a little bit, because they will think it will hurt their business with the sale of robots of universities but in reality students do not pay anyway for using them.  Renting Online will only bring new users to them. The will give you NAO for free, be sure, if they have some brains in a heads.

They move their robots with joystick mainly

can webots do this?


like create a model


and attach the joints in the software to the one in real life?

##### Emil Enchev 06/27/2019 14:23:49
I'm good exactly in MATH they are not. They so long trained their robots this mean they use test result as data for stabilization

##### Fabien Rohrer [Moderator] 06/27/2019 14:23:49
With model, I mean to train an artificial neural network or so.


Webots does not provide such kind of tools, but you can easily embed a library doing this.

##### Fabien Rohrer [Moderator] 06/27/2019 14:38:15
`@bing feng` At some point you need to switch to Webots (if you would like). Creating animation in robotics is not the best idea because very rigid. You could for example try to actuate the motors with sinus/cosinus, it's a good way to start. Take a look at our mantis.wbt example, for example.

##### bing feng 06/27/2019 14:38:42
..............


i have no idea what sinus and cosinus is


mainly cuz im not in uni


yet


in fact im still in hs

##### Fabien Rohrer [Moderator] 06/27/2019 14:39:36
a good exercise could be to open mantis.wbt in Webots and study the controller, play with variables, etc.

##### bing feng 06/27/2019 14:41:18
ill be sure to do so!

##### Emil Enchev 06/27/2019 15:17:50
`@Fabien Rohrer`  tell me something more about Nao fall = > camera break? Why their is not build in, protection software that will detect falling robot and take measures to protect camera?

##### Fabien Rohrer [Moderator] 06/27/2019 15:19:03
I think there are, but for sure, we can also bypass such kind of protection. I also think that it's a complex problem, not sure SoftBank adresses this perfectly.

##### Emil Enchev 06/27/2019 15:19:22
HeadPitch and HeadYaw will be enough for me

##### Fabien Rohrer [Moderator] 06/27/2019 15:19:53
When I was discussing of camera break before, I was speaking on another robot.


I had this issue on the Robotis Op

##### Emil Enchev 06/27/2019 15:20:46
Detect what position fall, and move head in other direction, after impact will compensate with slight moving to the flor to reduce impact forces

##### Fabien Rohrer [Moderator] 06/27/2019 15:20:52
For sure, there are simple ways to prevent breaks


I read a paper once about to bend the knees in case of fall, this prevents lot of impact forces.


I think it was an hot topic at robocup at some point, you may find literature there.


[https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6640493](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6640493) üòÉ

##### Emil Enchev 06/27/2019 15:26:52
When Softbank give you NAOs for rent, I will build the best protection system for them, to compensate some your repair costs. Bending knee is passive action of protection. There are active moves during impact which will compensate more.

##### Akash 06/27/2019 15:30:25
Is there any way by which the DistanceSensor's or the Compass's rate of response can be increase (decreasing the response time interval) ?

##### Fabien Rohrer [Moderator] 06/27/2019 15:30:46
Hi


The minimum refresh interval is given by WorldInfo.basicTimeStep


Then each sensor refresh rate can be set indepently using the "wb\_sensor\_enable" function


.. typically by a integer multiple of WorldInfo.basicTimeStep


`@Akash` I hope it answers your question.

##### Emil Enchev 06/27/2019 15:38:23
`@Akash` what is your problem exactly? Why you want to increase response of these sensors?

##### Akash 06/27/2019 16:02:37
`@Emil Enchev`   Because I am using distance sensors and compass to map surrounding just as a Lidar, Because of circular dynamic motion of the bot the response  distance sensors and compass are giving back are not proper (I don't want to use Lidar).

##### Emil Enchev 06/27/2019 16:05:38
Do you mean you check them too often, and this is time consuming  slowing down your remaining code?


Or you mean, that you want most fast to build the map?

##### Akash 06/27/2019 16:12:43
`@Fabien Rohrer`  reducing the time  WorldInfo.basicTimeStep is just giving me a lot more number of values but not proper values.

##### Emil Enchev 06/27/2019 16:15:28
The basicTimeStep field defines the duration of the simulation step executed by Webots. It is a floating point value expressed in milliseconds. The minimum value for this field is 0.001, that is, one microsecond. Setting this field to a high value will accelerate the simulation, but will decrease the accuracy and the stability, especially for physics computations and collision detection. It is usually recommended to tune this value in order to find a suitable speed/accuracy trade-off.


[https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/worldinfo](https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/worldinfo)


[https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/distancesensor](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/distancesensor)


The wb\_distance\_sensor\_enable function allows the user to enable distance sensor measurements. The sampling\_period argument specifies the sampling period of the sensor and is expressed in milliseconds. Note that the first measurement will be available only after the first sampling period elapsed.

##### Akash 06/27/2019 16:25:12
`@Emil Enchev`  No its not the code, its like when the robot is at 90 degree the  compass is reading it 43.(something) degree,  same thing is happening to the distance sensor. I can stretch the values of compass response array to 90 degree by adding  some increasing variable to each and every value in that array, but nothing can be done to the distancesensor's array values.

##### Emil Enchev 06/27/2019 16:26:28

The wb\_distance\_sensor\_get\_sampling\_period function returns the period given into the wb\_distance\_sensor\_enable function, or 0 if the device is disabled.

"Setting this field to a high value will accelerate the simulation, but will decrease the accuracy and the stability, especially for physics computations and collision detection. It is usually recommended to tune this value in order to find a suitable speed/accuracy trade-off." What is your value of  basicTimeStep


I'm totally newbie here this is why ask you


the problems of others can become mine too


Do you understand me `@Akash` . Probably your basicTimeStep was increased, and this is why you read wrong information from sensors.


Set it to minimum and see what will be result


0.001


Is this normal behavior of Webots to color the caption of the button controls when they are on focus?

Yes of course, this is done to help you visualize which item is currently focused

##### Emil Enchev 06/28/2019 06:59:11
For me it look like some sort of graphical defect. It disrupts the perception of the first letter and is irritating. The purple border is sufficient to indicate focus.

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 06/28/2019 07:01:10
There is indeed an issue with the first letter, we are aware of this, if it is irritating you, you can switch to the 'classic' them, the problem should not be present in this theme.

##### Emil Enchev 06/28/2019 07:09:01
I like dark. If you want simply put little purple dot outside of the caption to indicate focus something like this, but coloration on part of text is worse.

...create the problem. But with padding 1px 1px in one dialog problem resolve in other with default buttons the problem persist.


This mean: go to your Qt Editor, and check Button Controls Options  for all Dialogs they are the same and if they differ, by what options exactly.


I really don't understand nothing from Qt and making GUI with it, nor from Qt The Style Sheet but this is your problem.


Suggestion: First try to make the buttons bigger, `@David Mansolino`


Probably size of these buttons is too small, and when you make padding it eat from first letter small portion of pixels. Its create red color because of some semi-transparency shits  or something of the sort.

Hello. I am trying to implement a Deep Q Network in a webots environment. What i need to do,is "change" the robot after an amount of steps,with a seemingly new one. I dont want to reset the controller,since i dont want to lose the progress of the training. I have seen that there is a way to remove a robot via a supervisor command,but how can i instantly re-import it so it's like a new one? I want to do that,since after a number of steps and collisions,the robot is damaged and not functioning properly

Basically you can remove any node in the simulation using this function: [https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/supervisor#wb\_supervisor\_node\_remove](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/supervisor#wb_supervisor_node_remove)

`@Emil Enchev` thank you for the investigation, we will try to fix this as soon as we have some time.

##### roboshiv 06/28/2019 15:06:48
when I try a different project it works fine. This project uses some matrices which are 16*16 containing doubles which are weights for a simple neural net, nothing massive. and the compiled file is only 19.2 kB

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 06/28/2019 15:07:45
The memory on the first generation of e-pucks is really limited, it is highly probable that the matrice is too big for the e-puck memory.


Maybe you can try to switch from double to float to save some memory.

Haha yes thanks we were literally trying that to see what happens


but unfortunately it didn't work


So this error just means we don't have enough space on the epuck? What type of memory are we running out of? RAM?

Hello I am new  to Webots and I am trying to simulate my robot; however I created it using Autodesk Inventor and the file is a *.iam, is there a way to add it in to the simulation world?

##### Fabien Rohrer [Moderator] 06/28/2019 20:05:06
Not as-is unfortunately: Webots doesn‚Äôt have a .iam importer. I think the simplest way is to find a way to import it in Blender (which supports lot of formats) and then use the blender2webots add on:

##### MariusJuston [Moderator] 07/01/2019 01:12:47
Sorry, I have been trying to set up my robot *.iam file through Blender and I have not managed to figure out how to do it. I have managed to export the file as a *.wrl; however, I have no idea how I would actually set it up in Webots, it is a simple 6 axis robot however how do you set up a custom robot from a custom .wrl? 

Also, how do you set up the joints and the sensors, if you have to do it through Blender how would you do this? 

On another note I am trying to import another model to be an object that the robot would need to interact with, again I have the *.iam and I have managed to convert it to a *.wrl; however, when I import the created *.wrl from the Webots Import VRML97 functionality I get a big list of Shape objects, how do I group them into a single Solid?

Many thanks!

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 07/01/2019 06:47:35
`@MohamedSabry`, this is probably caused by an incompatible library in your PATH, can you please try to delete the file 'protofile\_matlab\_2018b\_webots\_R2019a.m' in your temporary files and then retry (this file will be regenerated by Webots).

For more information, please have a look at this issue (exact same problem): [https://github.com/omichel/webots/issues/63](https://github.com/omichel/webots/issues/63)

##### Fabien Rohrer [Moderator] 07/01/2019 06:47:52
`@MariusJuston` Do you have any possibility to export your file to something else than a *.iam? Blender supports better other formats like *.x3d, *.collada, etc. To set the joints/sensors, please refer to the README here: [https://github.com/omichel/blender-webots-exporter](https://github.com/omichel/blender-webots-exporter) If you don't want to use the addon, you can indeed import the wrl shapes (it's regular it's a list)  directly into a new Solid node (by copy-pasting the Shapes into the new Solid.children fields).

Hello, I have a little question, maybe someone can help me: I want to call a supervisor service via ROS. The controller connects successfully to the ROS master, but when I call a service  in the terminal, the controller always crashes.



This is my imput to the command line:  "rosservice call /myBot/supervisor/node/get\_position "node: 0""



"node: 0" is obviously wrong, but what would be the right argument? Or am I completely misusing the supervisor functions?

##### bing feng 07/01/2019 08:18:57

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 07/01/2019 09:17:58
`@Marcey`, you should first call the  '/supervisor/get\_from\_def' ([https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/supervisor?tab=ros#wb\_supervisor\_node\_get\_from\_def](https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/supervisor?tab=ros#wb_supervisor_node_get_from_def)) service to get the id of the node.

How can i  read a character from the keyboard as an example of the 's'?

##### Stefania Pedrazzi [cyberbotics] 07/03/2019 06:00:15
`@Gabriel_martinez` to read the keyboard input from a controller you have to use the Keyboard API: [https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/keyboard#wb\_keyboard\_get\_key](https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/keyboard#wb_keyboard_get_key).

In the `projects/languages` folder you can find an example of controller written in C++, Java, and Python. For a C example please look at the `samples/devices/worlds/gps.wbt` simulation.

##### El\_Samu\_El 07/03/2019 10:14:05
I have a question about parallel execution of several webots instances. It seems like parallel execution does not really give any significant speedup. I have access to a cloud instance with 96 cores and around 360 GB RAM. When I launch 40 webots instances to run 100 timesteps each, then this is not (significantly) faster then running 4000 timesteps on a single instance on my local 8GB machine.  I open the instances via the subprocess module of python. They do in fact all run in parallel, but the more instances I start, the slower each of them gets. Where is the bottleneck? Do all of them use shared ressources?


It is run on Ubuntu 18.04 without a gpu

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 07/03/2019 10:18:38
It could be the graphics.

##### El\_Samu\_El 07/03/2019 10:18:41
the controllers are basically just getting observations from the sensors, feeding this through a tensorflow graph and then actuating the motors


i fast forward all simulations


so I don't see graphics

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 07/03/2019 10:19:06
If your cloud has no graphics hardware acceleration, this could be the bottleneck.


Did you try to run the simulation in fast mode?

##### El\_Samu\_El 07/03/2019 10:19:36
yes, they all are run in fast mode

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 07/03/2019 10:19:58
Do you use camera, lidar or range finders in your simulations?


All these rely on OpenGL acceleration.

##### El\_Samu\_El 07/03/2019 10:20:29
I use accelerometer, imu, gyro, position sensors, force sensors and 3 type of motors


but no self collision

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 07/03/2019 10:20:45
OK, so it shouldn't be the problem.


So, I have no clue on what could be the bottleneck, you should investigate it on your cluster.

##### El\_Samu\_El 07/03/2019 10:22:41
does in your experience parallelization work fine?


before I jump into that

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 07/03/2019 10:23:32
We don't have much experience in running Webots on such computer clusters.

##### El\_Samu\_El 07/03/2019 10:23:51
okay I understand, thanks Olivier

##### nisuunn 07/03/2019 11:30:25
Hi! I would like to send data with an emitter from a robot controller script to a supervisor. Where should the supervisor's receiver be and how can I access the receiver with the Supervisor?

##### Fabien Rohrer [Moderator] 07/03/2019 11:34:35
You could simply add your Receiver as a child of the supervisor. (a supervisor is a Robot with the supervisor field enabled; it acts the same as a robot controller, but access to supplementary functions).


so you could refer simply to the receiver doc: [https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/receiver](https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/receiver)

##### nisuunn 07/03/2019 11:37:38
In my case I cannot connect the supervisor to my robot, as the supervisor spawns a new robot so there would be an endless loop of spawning new robots.


But, I think maybe I can work out some way around this.


Thanks for the help!

##### MariusJuston [Moderator] 07/03/2019 18:36:31
Hello I seem to be having some issues, I have a custom made part that was created from inventor, exported as an .stl, converted using blender into a .wrl and then imported into Webots. When it is imported into Webots it is depicted as a Shape so I copy pasted it into a Solid object, because the shape was complex I just used a Box as a bounding object; however, the origin point was not in the center of the part so I had to wrap the Box with a Transform object. When I start the simulation the object just sinks into the ground a few centimeters. I have tried changing the basicTimStep, and the ERP but I have had no success.


I seem to have figured out the problem, objects a rest sink in the ground by default because of their weights. I will just make the weight of the objects very little and it should work

##### Fabien Rohrer [Moderator] 07/04/2019 05:38:43
Hi Marius, yes heavy robots can ¬´¬†sink¬†¬ª with the default physics parameters. Rather than changing the masses, you should rather modify the ContactProperties softCFM value.

I'm trying to create a python controller, and I'm trying to create other python files alongside the controller file to reduce clutter. I've been changing my runtime.ini file to :

```ini
[python]
OPTIONS = -m demo_controller
```


and I use imports with the following method:

```python
from .utils import *
```


and it tells me that there is no parent directory set up


does anyone know if there's a way to fix this or if I have to do everything in the one controller file?

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 07/05/2019 15:30:08

how did you set it up?

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 07/05/2019 15:30:42
my main python file is called supervisor.py


I have another python file called constants.py


from supervisor.py, I simply "import constants"


and it works.

##### ThundrHawk 07/05/2019 15:31:32
and you have your robot's controller set to "supervisor"?

Yes, but this should make no difference.

##### ThundrHawk 07/05/2019 15:31:58
alright thanks i'll see if that works

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 07/05/2019 15:32:20
Sorry, yes it is important (I did get your question).


And my supervisor.py is stored into a folder called "supervisor".


which is a subfolder of the controllers directory.


Well, something standard in Webots.

##### ThundrHawk 07/05/2019 15:33:22
alright

your constants.py file is in the same folder?

Yes.

##### ThundrHawk 07/05/2019 15:36:08
alright it looks like that works. I suppose I was confused because I'm using PyCharm for the coding, and it's telling me it can't find the module


thanks for your help

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 07/05/2019 15:36:24
No problem, you are welcome.


Maybe you should configure PyCharm so that it searches for modules in the current folder as well.

##### ThundrHawk 07/05/2019 15:59:21
yeah we stuck it in a try except to make pycharm happy

##### Fabien Rohrer [Moderator] 07/08/2019 06:30:20
`@NearMonzter` From SolidWork, you can export a VRML or X3D file, and then you can import it in Webots as a Shape (the graphical info only). Alternatively, you can use Blender inbetween and add more information (collisions, masses, joints, etc.), using this addon: [https://github.com/omichel/blender-webots-exporter](https://github.com/omichel/blender-webots-exporter)

##### OnlyPtuuu 07/08/2019 13:27:13
Because in aldebaran documentation say to use this version


Do you advice downloading the latest version?

##### Fabien Rohrer [Moderator] 07/08/2019 13:29:22
Ok, I think you can use the latest version, it will solves more issues than others. However, in recent Webots versions, you have to install naoqisim by yourself from this deprecated repo: [https://github.com/omichel/naoqisim](https://github.com/omichel/naoqisim)


Webots is free and open-source since R2019a.

Modeling a humanoid robot model is not a simple task. And it depends on your skills, your input data, etc.


A good strategy would be to find a good 3D model of the Pepper, for example here: [https://www.turbosquid.com/fr/3d-model/softbank-robotics](https://www.turbosquid.com/fr/3d-model/softbank-robotics)


And to use the Webots2blender addon to import it in Webots:  [https://github.com/omichel/blender-webots-exporter](https://github.com/omichel/blender-webots-exporter)

Hello, is there a way to make the program "wait" until the set\_position of a motor is finished? If that is not possible is it possible to get the current position of a RotationMotor, please? Many thanks

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 07/08/2019 15:54:37
Yes, the idea is to use a position sensors([https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/positionsensor](https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/positionsensor)) and to call the robot step function until the desired position is reached.

##### MariusJuston [Moderator] 07/08/2019 15:57:19
Doesn't the Motor object have to know its own position in order for set position to work? Does it not store that information as a variable that could be accessed?

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 07/08/2019 15:57:57
No, it only stores the target position, you should use the position sensor associated to the same joint that the motor

##### MariusJuston [Moderator] 07/08/2019 15:59:02
Okay, thank you

Sorry me again, is there a way to retrieve the bounding box of an node? If so if the bounding box was a box would it be possible to extract the height? I would like to implement this in Python, please. Many thanks

##### Fabien Rohrer [Moderator] 07/08/2019 18:32:10
The Supervisor API can be used for retrieving any node field, typically the position or the size IF these fields are open! You can retrieve programmatically all what you sea in the tree view on the left. There is currently no method to retrieve the AABB.

hello everyone.....how can i add some characters in my webots project ,something like pedestrians in the  road or like  human ...please help me

##### Fabien Rohrer [Moderator] 07/09/2019 06:57:14
Please look at this world file: $(WEBOTS\_HOME)/projects/humans/pedestrian/worlds/pedestrian.wbt

There is a Pedestrian PROTO file that you can use everywhere, its parameters can be used to define an itinerary in absolute coordinates, speed, etc.

##### aji 07/09/2019 07:57:23
Hello! I have a question regarding WeBots and Choregraph (for NAO bot). Does anybody know why there are no robots on the list of connection in Choregraph?


I tried running a sample world with a NAO bot on it, then my choregraph wont show the NAO bot on the "Make a connection" list

##### Fabien Rohrer [Moderator] 07/09/2019 07:59:45
Hi,  we don't support anymore naoqisim (the controller responsible in doing the connection between Webots and Choregraph) because SoftBank abandoned the support of the library doing this.


That said, did you tried basic things:


- the controller and Webots should be in run mode


- the ports should match (an argument of naoqisim if I remember well)


- The port should not be blocked (by another badly closed connection, or by your firewall)


- Are you sure naoqisim is running smoothly? (what do you have in the Webots console)


I hope this will gives you clues to go ahead.

##### aji 07/09/2019 08:03:01
Ah, that's quite unfortunate.


Will try to do the following things, i just set up both of the programs so i havent quite tinkered with it yet

##### Fabien Rohrer [Moderator] 07/09/2019 08:04:38
Defintively! The decision of SoftBank to drop the support of any simulator is weird, many users/customers are complaining about this. I recommend you to send them an e-mail to complain about this.


(the more we are to complain, the best chance we have to change the situation üòÉ )

##### aji 07/09/2019 08:08:27
That's a good suggestion. They clearly didnt involve as much features as webots on their own choregraph simulator (i.e. speech recognition).


Thanks for the help btw üòÑ

are mecanum wheels supported?

##### Fabien Rohrer [Moderator] 07/10/2019 06:36:53
Hi, yes they are!


You could either implement the entire mechanism with joints and cylinders for each sub wheel, like in this example: [https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/samples-howto#omni\_wheels-wbt](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/samples-howto#omni_wheels-wbt)


Or you could use the asymmetric friction (cf. WorldInfo.contactProperties.coulombFriction ) to simulate sub wheels, like in the Kuka youbot robot: [https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/youbot](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/youbot)


When implementing the youBot, I have done lot of tests related to this, and the second solution (the one used by the youBot) is much more accurate, robust and quick to solve of our physics engine.


In this movie (at time = 71s), we can see an older version of the youBot with the subwheels entirely modeled: [https://youtu.be/vFwNwT8dZTU?t=71](https://youtu.be/vFwNwT8dZTU?t=71) but this has been dropped to use the asymmetric friction in newer versions.

any idea what might have went wrong?

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 07/10/2019 12:01:45

Hello! Can the software simulate wheel slips? Preferably on an inclined surface or on a slippery surface.

##### Fabien Rohrer [Moderator] 07/10/2019 14:01:43
Hi,


Yes, you should play with the WorldInfo.contactProperties, particularily the one dealing with the contact between the surface and the wheel.


[https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/contactproperties](https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/contactproperties)


in particular, the coulombFriction and the forceDependentSlip fields

thank you man.

##### MariusJuston [Moderator] 07/10/2019 22:19:40
Hello is there a simple way to make a robot arm move smoothly? When I use setPosition on the joints it is very choppy because it seems that it is moving the joints sequentially. Is it possible to move the joints in parallel in Python? Also is there a way to do some kind of object bound detection and have the program display an alert that the housing boxes gave collided? Many thanks!

##### ThundrHawk 07/10/2019 22:42:19
If you use set velocity, they'll move at the same time. you would just then have to figure out when to stop then

##### speedy6451 07/10/2019 22:42:53
How do you change the language of a robot controller?

##### ThundrHawk 07/10/2019 22:43:21
you just have to write it in a new language and tell the robot to use that one

##### speedy6451 07/10/2019 23:16:52
I figured it out, thanks!

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 07/11/2019 06:22:46
`@MariusJuston` about the boxes collision, the simplest solution is probably to add a touchSensors ([https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/touchsensor](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/touchsensor)) to your robot arm.

##### MariusJuston [Moderator] 07/11/2019 14:08:00
Thank you. Sorry again but I seem to have some issues with the PositionSensors, I have not moved the robot yet and the values the sensors are returning to me are not 0. I assume that that is not normal. Is there a way to reset/zero the sensor?

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 07/11/2019 14:18:06
The position sensors will return the value of the jointparameter.position field (if any) is it not the case ?

##### ThundrHawk 07/11/2019 14:29:16
We figured it out. We had set the position to infinity when we grabbed them from the supervisor, but we hadn't set their velocity to 0 at that time. We only did it after they had already moved a bit.

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 07/11/2019 14:30:16
Ok, thank you for the feedback, that sounds indeed like a very good reason.

##### R\_LCL 07/11/2019 17:55:59
Hello, I need help with the getVelocity() function. I used the getFromDef function and assigned it to my robot. But, as you can see in the  attached picture, the velocity values that I'm getting are all zeroes. May I know what am I doing wrong?

##### MariusJuston [Moderator] 07/11/2019 18:36:12
`@R_LCL` it seems that you are retrieving your velocity at initialization when the robot is not moving. If you want to retrieve the velocities continuously you want to use the getVelocity method inside the while loop


setVelocity is nice and all but if possible I would like to use setPosition to make my life easier. Is there a way to multi-thread setPosition?

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 07/11/2019 19:04:00
`@MariusJuston` , the idea is actually to use both the setPosition and setVelocity function, the first sets the target position and the second defines the maximum allowed velocity to reach this target position.

##### MariusJuston [Moderator] 07/11/2019 19:14:14
I understand that; however, I am using a 6 DOF robot arm and I want to make the joints in sync and thus make the motion seem smooth, with the setPosition it is very choppy because it is moving the motors sequentially.

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 07/11/2019 19:17:19
You should be able to call the setPosition for each motor at the same step and they should move all in parallel isn't it the case?

##### MariusJuston [Moderator] 07/11/2019 19:17:46
No it does not seem so

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 07/11/2019 19:18:14
Here is for example a robot arm controlled in Webots: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jq0-DkEwwj4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jq0-DkEwwj4)

##### MariusJuston [Moderator] 07/11/2019 19:18:51
Yes how they do it is that they use setPosition in very small intervals

##### ThundrHawk 07/11/2019 19:21:38

we may be using it wrong, but we're running this bit of code:

```python
for motor, position in zip(motors, positions):
    motor.setPosition(position)
    motor.setVelocity(MAX_V)
```


I've tried running those functions with the threading library to the same results. I could be doing something wrong with that, though

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 07/11/2019 19:25:22
Using thread should not help because in any case the simulation time will increase only when you call the robot step function.

##### ThundrHawk 07/11/2019 19:25:33
makes sense

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 07/11/2019 19:25:58
But the bit of code you sent seems correct, this should work


You should probably try reproducing the problem in a minimalistic example (e.g. just two DOF) and post an issue with this example on github: [https://github.com/omichel/webots/issues/new/choose](https://github.com/omichel/webots/issues/new/choose)

##### ThundrHawk 07/12/2019 01:55:04
the first thing you should try is adding PYTHONPATH as an environment variable: [https://stackoverflow.com/a/4855685](https://stackoverflow.com/a/4855685)

then if you're having more trouble, go into Tools>Preferences and change the python command to the python executable. mine is:

`C:\Users\Russell\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python37\python`


ideally, changing the environment variable will work, but it can be tricky


make sure to restart webots after making changes to your environment variables

##### MerySgh 07/12/2019 01:56:31
okay i will try

##### MariusJuston [Moderator] 07/12/2019 01:59:34
`@MerySgh`  Otherwise you can just pass in the Python.exe path in webots ->  Tools -> Preferences -> python. i.e: C:\Users\\...\Anaconda3\envs\\...\python.exe

##### MerySgh 07/12/2019 02:01:43

##### MariusJuston [Moderator] 07/12/2019 02:01:58
Replace the python command with the path of the python exe

where i can find this this path ?

##### MariusJuston [Moderator] 07/12/2019 02:02:43

##### MerySgh 07/12/2019 02:03:09
NOT yet

##### MariusJuston [Moderator] 07/12/2019 02:03:49
Okay that is good. Is you python a virtual environment?

##### ThundrHawk 07/12/2019 02:05:13
if you're using python37, the path is most likely going to be C:\Users\<user>\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python37\python.exe

##### MerySgh 07/12/2019 02:05:46
`@MariusJuston`  sorry i don't understand you


`@ThundrHawk` i will try it

##### MariusJuston [Moderator] 07/12/2019 02:06:47
```python
import sys
print(sys.executable)
```


This will give you the Python path of you running python.exe


Paste that in the  Python command field

##### ThundrHawk 07/12/2019 02:07:29
you're probably not using a virtual environment if you're not programming in an ide

##### MerySgh 07/12/2019 02:10:15

%end

##### MariusJuston [Moderator] 07/12/2019 02:11:25
`@MerySgh`  No sorry about that it seems that I was not very clear. That was a Python command. You can open up your python console and run those commands to give you the location. When you install Python it comes with  IDLE search for that and then run the command


`@MerySgh`  If you think that you are only going to be using a single Python interpreter for all your projects/worlds it might just be easier for you to place your python path as an environmental variable.

##### MerySgh 07/12/2019 02:15:29
mmmmm ok I will try, I'm sorry if you don't understand quickly it's because I'm still beginner I trying to  be adapted to these technical words

##### MariusJuston [Moderator] 07/12/2019 02:17:21
No problems. I will be sure to clarify as much as I can.


`@MerySgh` So a Python Interpreter is what contains the python.exe and contains all the libraries and dependencies associated with it (as far as I understand it).

A virtual environment in python is useful if you have multiple projects and these projects differ. Such a vision processing project and a text editor project. As you can imagine these for two projects you would need very different libraries. If you used a single interpreter you would have to install the libraries to a single python interpreter, meaning that each project would contain both python projects libraries because they are both referencing the same interpreter and you are installing the libraries to a single interpreter. If you use virtual environments it copies over to a new folder a "clean" copy of your python base interpreter as a separate environment. In the previous example, you would create 2 virtual environments: one for the vision processing project and one for the text editor project. That would allow you to install the libraries for the vision processing project and which would only be available to that project and same with the text editor libraries and environment. This allows your python interpreters to be more lightweight and usually makes it easier for IDEs, you also delete these virtual environments without needing to reinstall Python, etc... (this is how I understand it)

I personally really like Anaconda for creating virtual environments and PyCharm as my Python IDE. Anaconda and PyCharm make it very easy to install libraries and create virtual environments for your projects. (this is of course just my opinion there are plenty more of other IDE and Virtual environment options)

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 07/12/2019 13:52:04
Hi, I am not sure to understand your question, the e-puck robot is already a differential wheel, you should simply use its position-sensors to get the wheel position.


(which you can then derive to get the speed)

##### R\_LCL 07/12/2019 13:58:59

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 07/12/2019 14:00:08
I am sorry but this node is deprecated, it is highly recommended to use the regular robot node instead (and the e-puck model has been updated accordingly)


You can add noise on the position-senors too, the speed can be retrieved, etc. all the functionnalities are also available.

Last week I was working with my three wheels omnidirectional robot that I created,  so far I've programmed it into two mode (manual and autonomous), so far so good, the issue is when in the autonomous mode, when I detect an obstacle through a distance sensor I want my robot to stop and THEN, if the obstacle is more to the left TURN the robot to the right, however I don't know how to make the robot  wait a little bit stopped a little bit and then turn the robot

You could take a copy-paste the ¬´¬†wait\_a\_while¬†¬ª function (and the required ¬´¬†step¬†¬ª function defined above) in your code: [https://github.com/omichel/webots/blob/revision/projects/robots/kinematics/tinkerbots/controllers/crane/crane.c#L33](https://github.com/omichel/webots/blob/revision/projects/robots/kinematics/tinkerbots/controllers/crane/crane.c#L33)


This function calls the wb\_robot\_step() function several times until reaching the expected time (in seconds) It is based on the wb\_robot\_get\_time() function. You should obviously stop the motors before calling ¬´¬†wait\_a\_while¬†¬ª.

Hi, yes, many.


Let me check..


In WEBOTS\_HOME/projects/robots/gctronic/e-puck/worlds/e-puck\_cross-compilation.wbt the accelerometer is used to analyse the slope inclination, the most bottom led is enabled accordingly.


Is it sufficient?

##### Akash 07/15/2019 09:57:36
What should be the values of lookup table  for accelerometer and how could i convert it to m/s^2 from vector values?

##### Fabien Rohrer [Moderator] 07/15/2019 10:00:05
The lookupTable, is simply a function converting the vector in m/s^2 (typically [0, -9.81, 0]) to something else. It is applied on each channel independently.


You may find here how a lookup table is working: [https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/distancesensor#lookup-table](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/distancesensor#lookup-table)


So, to have the values of an accelerometer without alterating it, you could define a lookupTable like this:


lookupTable []


The default lookupTable does not do any interpolation.

thank you sir

but i have asked for the shoulder motion because it is not moving the hand while moving.

I replaced the elbow command to shoulder pitch


It is working now


But now only shoulder is moving, robot is not moving


And showing this error again and again

Sorry to disturb you

And thank you for your help



Can't we make NAO move hand as we do while walking

##### Fabien Rohrer [Moderator] 07/15/2019 15:25:21
In the controller I sent you, you can refer to another motor, for example by changing "RElbowYaw" to "RShoulderPitch"

##### Deleted User 07/15/2019 15:27:15
Yes sir 

I tried the same 



Isnt this little ocward

Means, the movement of hand 



How to change that angle sir

##### Fabien Rohrer [Moderator] 07/15/2019 15:32:11
In the code I sent you, the shoulder is actuated by a sin() function. You could play with this by adding constants, for example:


AMPLITUDE * sin(FREQUENCY * time) + OFFSET


You may find values for these constants in order to match with the gait.

##### Deleted User 07/15/2019 15:37:33

Why this error appears ??

##### Fabien Rohrer [Moderator] 07/15/2019 17:50:56
It could be explained if the path to ¬´¬†Forwards50.motion¬†¬ª is wrong. Could you check this file exists? It is defined relatively to your controller directory.

##### Deleted User 07/15/2019 17:55:33
I was working on it for about 2 and half hours 

But unable to get the resulf üòî 



Sir my objective is simple



I want the same control as in Nao\_demo.c



I want to make it walk when i press the button as mentioned in demo code. 

The only thing i am not getting is the hand movement as we do.



I need to control it by pressing the button 

Means it should move when i press the button along with the shoulder pitch


i am pressing the forward button in Nao\_demo.c controller, it is moving forward but hand is not moving.



What i need is, when i press the forwars button it should move along with moving the hand.

##### Fabien Rohrer [Moderator] 07/15/2019 18:08:10
Sorry to read this üòï I think you should focus first with running the controller I sent you. I tested it and it is working.

You have this error because of this line:


WbMotionRef forwards = wbu\_motion\_new("../../motions/Forwards50.motion");


The motion file cannot be found, therefore, forwards == NULL.


Please check in your file system that "PATH\_TO\_YOUR\_CONTROLLER/../../motions/Forwards50.motion" exists, if not, copy-paste it.

##### MariusJuston [Moderator] 07/16/2019 13:57:51
Hello, good gentlemen's i am trying to run a python controller from PyCharm without needing to run Webots. The problem is that it says that: 

```python
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "C:/Users/***/Documents/GitHub/***/***/controllers/state_controller/state_controller.py", line 40, in <module>
    from controller import Supervisor, Motor
  File "C:\Users\***\AppData\Local\Programs\Webots\lib\python37\controller.py", line 17, in <module>
    import _controller
ImportError: DLL load failed: The specified module could not be found.
```

I am trying to load the DLLs; however, I have not managed to find them. I have added `'C:\\Users\\***\\AppData\\Local\\Programs\\Webots\\lib\\python37'` to my `sys.path` variable already.

What can I do to make this work?

Many thanks!

##### Fabien Rohrer [Moderator] 07/16/2019 14:00:16
Hi Marius,


Yes, it seems to be a DLL or path issue.


the path you are including is indeed correct and should contain all the Python3 stuff. I will just check this to confirm it.

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 07/16/2019 14:03:23
Hi Marius, you probably need to add another path:


C:\\Users\\***\\AppData\\Local\\Programs\\Webots\\msys64\\mingw64\\bin


So that Python will be able to load the Controller.dll library.

##### MariusJuston [Moderator] 07/16/2019 14:37:13
`@Olivier Michel` it seems that it is still doing the same thing...

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 07/16/2019 14:38:05
Then, can you try to add this path to your "Path" environment variable?

##### MariusJuston [Moderator] 07/16/2019 14:38:19
Will do!


`@Olivier Michel`  Still does not work even when I added it to my Path environmental variable

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 07/16/2019 14:41:21
Do you get the same error?

##### MariusJuston [Moderator] 07/16/2019 14:41:26
yes


I can see it in `sys.path` though


I do not have the WEBOTS\_HOME environmental variable is that something I should set (I am in Windows)? Am I supposed to do that myself or is the installer supposed to do that?

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 07/16/2019 14:49:39
Yes.


No, you should do it yourself.


Did you follow the instructions here: [https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/running-extern-robot-controllers?](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/running-extern-robot-controllers?)

##### MariusJuston [Moderator] 07/16/2019 14:52:08
Still no... 
```bash
echo %WEBOTS_HOME%
C:\Users\***\AppData\Local\Programs\Webots\
```

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 07/16/2019 14:52:29
There is quite a large number of environment variables to setup.

##### MariusJuston [Moderator] 07/16/2019 14:54:07
Would you be so kind as to inform me of what they are please?

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 07/16/2019 14:54:27
They are all documented on the web page I pointed out.

##### MariusJuston [Moderator] 07/16/2019 14:54:44
Sorry I did not see the link

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 07/16/2019 14:54:46
[https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/running-extern-robot-controllers](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/running-extern-robot-controllers)


(there was an extra question mark making my previous link wrong)

##### MariusJuston [Moderator] 07/16/2019 14:58:30
By the way the documentation for that table is probably outdated becasue for windows it is saying that the WEBOTS\_HOME directory is at C:\Program Files\Webots when it is actually: C:\Users\***\AppData\Local\Programs\Webots\

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 07/16/2019 14:59:39
Yes, that's because you installed Webots for a single user (without administrator privileges).

##### MariusJuston [Moderator] 07/16/2019 15:00:00
makes sense

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 07/16/2019 15:00:15
So, it is correct to set it to C:\Users***\AppData\Local\Programs\Webots in your case.

##### MariusJuston [Moderator] 07/16/2019 15:04:48
Again I have setup all the environmental variables (except for the Python PYTHONPATH and PYTHONENCODING because I am using an env) for Windows, WEBOTS\_HOME and added mingw64 to the environment. It still does not work... same old error

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 07/16/2019 15:05:25
Let me try it.

##### MariusJuston [Moderator] 07/16/2019 15:08:58

I could follow the instructions and launch my python controller from a MSYS2 console without any problem.


I will now try from a DOS console...


Are you sure you have a 64 bit python?

##### MariusJuston [Moderator] 07/16/2019 15:19:04
Python 3.7.3 (default, Apr 24 2019, 15:29:51) [MSC v.1915 64 bit (AMD64)] on win32

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 07/16/2019 15:19:09
OK.


For me it also works from a DOS console.


So, I don't understand why it doesn't work from your PyCharm environment...

##### MariusJuston [Moderator] 07/16/2019 15:33:37
is there anything I could provide you in order to help you troubleshoot?

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 07/16/2019 15:34:18
I believe the next step would be for me to install PyCharm and try from there.


But I don't time right now (I am flying to China very soon).

##### MariusJuston [Moderator] 07/16/2019 15:35:23
No problems, thank you very much for the time that you have sent trying to help me! I really appreciate it!

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 07/16/2019 15:40:59
Last thing to try: could try to use pythonw.exe (instead of python.exe) to execute your robot controller? It seems that makes a difference in some cases.

##### MariusJuston [Moderator] 07/16/2019 15:48:37
sadly no...

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 07/16/2019 15:51:35
Also, can you try to launch your python controller from a DOS CMD by typing "python my\_controller.py" in the controller folder?

##### MariusJuston [Moderator] 07/16/2019 15:54:01
No it does not work for either: `C:\Users\***\Anaconda3\envs\***\python.exe state_controller/state_controller.py`. For `C:\Users\***\Anaconda3\envs\***\pythonw.exe state_controller/state_controller.py` it does not print anything even though there are print statements, so i am assuming that it is not working

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 07/17/2019 18:18:54
Hi, the simplest solution is to save your world and open the world file in your text editor, this way you will see the format of all the nodes you have in the 'children' field, you can simply copy paste the content of the 'children' field from your world file to your PROTO file.

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 07/22/2019 06:14:18
Hi `@Nora`, please use the technical-questions' for futur questions.

About omnidirectional wheels the simplest (and most efficient solution) is to use asymetric friction (this can be defined in the Worldinfo.contactproperties field). Please have a look at these examples where the youbot robot uses this mechanism: [https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/youbot#samples](https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/youbot#samples)


`@Deleted User` The shoulder is not moving because the motion file does not contain any value for the shoulders, if you want them to move you have to either use another motion file or modify this motion file to add shoulder value. For more information about motion files please refer to: [https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/motion-functions](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/motion-functions)


`@MerySgh`, `@MariusJuston` is completely right, since each one (the car and the robot) is using its own seperated controller you should be able to have one of them in C (which you need to compile) and on of them in PYthon (which of course doesn't need to be compiled, but please make sure you have correctly setup Python: [https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/using-python](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/using-python)).

However, if you want one (or more) of the pedestrian to be a 'static' passenger of the car, it is strongly recommended to put it's 'controller' field to `""`, or you can use the 'MotorbikeDriver' ([https://github.com/omichel/webots/blob/revision/projects/vehicles/protos/generic/MotorbikeDriver.proto](https://github.com/omichel/webots/blob/revision/projects/vehicles/protos/generic/MotorbikeDriver.proto)), which is already in the correct position (but in that case it should be 'encapsulated' in a Slot node: [https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/slot](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/slot))

##### ShravanTata 07/22/2019 12:30:14
Hi Cyberbotics, Is there a way to launch Webots with a particular python command to run the controller instead of setting it globally in the preferences?

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 07/22/2019 12:47:03
Hi Sharavan, yes you can add a 'runtime.ini' file in the same directory than your controller. This is documented here: [https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/controller-programming#languages-settings](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/controller-programming#languages-settings)

It seems that your system blocks the jsdelivr CDN


Maybe you blacklisted it by some operation.

##### MariusJuston [Moderator] 07/22/2019 13:36:01
To be honest I have no idea how to do that, nor what jsdelivr CDN is

##### Fabien Rohrer [Moderator] 07/22/2019 13:36:40
haha, sorry, I write this loudly. Let me check if I can find a procedure to help you..


The Webots website requires some resources which are on another website: jsdelivr and these resources cannot be loaded on your computer.

However, I want the htc vive headset can    show the webot enviroment simulation view. Does anyone know how to solve this problem~?Thanks!

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 07/23/2019 07:54:50
Hi, `@Chen-moon` , Webots does support indeed the HTC Vive out of the box if you are on Windows and you have SteamVR Installed: [https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/computer-peripherals#virtual-reality-headset](https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/computer-peripherals#virtual-reality-headset)

You can enable it from the 'View' menu: [https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/the-user-interface#view-menu](https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/the-user-interface#view-menu)

##### Chen-moon 07/23/2019 07:59:53
Hi `@David Mansolino` ,thanks for your response, I just see your second websites and set the enable control.However, after I set the enable control, the view in webot  become all blue(which meens the robotic arm I have set just disappear)


Have you ever meet this problem~?Thanks!

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 07/23/2019 08:04:29
In the View->Virtual Reality Headset have you checked 'View left eye' (or right) ?

##### Chen-moon 07/23/2019 08:07:47
Hi `@David Mansolino` ,these setting (View left eye(right eye))I have tried, but the view is still all  blue ..

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 07/23/2019 08:29:43
`@Chen-moon`, ok can you see something in the headset? Have you tried with various samples world distributed within Webots ?

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 07/23/2019 08:30:39
`@Huey`, you should probably put a camera onboard your robot and perform image processing to detect the target, navigate towards it and push it to the goal.

##### Huey 07/23/2019 08:34:00

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 07/24/2019 06:16:25
`@Chen-moon` , thank you for the bug report, I did indeed saw it. We don't have any headset available right now, but we will try as soon as we have it back and let you know.

In the meantime, I saw that you have a HTC Vive Pro (I did try only with the HTC Vive for now), can you try reducing the resolution to ~50% (this is feasible in the preferences of SteamVR, then you have to restart Webots once changed)?


`@MariusJuston`, unfortunately I don't see any simple solution, we are indeed missing a `wb_supervisor_field_remove_sf` and `wb_supervisor_field_import_sf_node` function. Maybe someone else has an idea for a workaroud ?

`@Deleted User` The shoulder is not moving because the motion file does not contain any value for the shoulders, if you want them to move you have to either use another motion file or modify this motion file to add shoulder value.

Hello Fabien


I want to simulate drone on WEBOTS...How should I proceed?

##### Fabien Rohrer [Moderator] 07/24/2019 14:16:09
The most important node to master is the Propeller node:


[https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/propeller](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/propeller)


It allows to simulate a thrust.


(a controllable and customizable force and torque applied on some solid)


You may find an example of the Propeller use here: [https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/samples-devices#propeller-wbt](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/samples-devices#propeller-wbt)


It shows 3 different designs of helicopter. This is definitively a good starting point.


Funny enough, I'm currently working on a better drone demo.


It's already in our revision branch, but not released on a stable release.


It's a model of the DJI Mavic 2 PRO:

I'm about to release a demo movie on youTube about this.


To go further than Propellers, fluid can be simulated too, in a basic way.


In my Mavic simulation, I only set some global damping.


But Webots supports basic fluids like in this demo:

`@Huey` : yes you are initializing the devices in the wrong way. You have to use the Robot API to get device instance: [https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/robot?tab=java#getaccelerometer](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/robot?tab=java#getaccelerometer)


You can find a java example at projects/languages/java/worlds/example.wbt


another very simple one is also included in the User Guide: [https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/cpp-java-python#java-example](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/cpp-java-python#java-example)

Sorry about this but I am trying to have this box use conveyor belts to move from one place to another and there needs to be a gap in between the conveyors as such. I am using the Webots conveyor belt robots; however, the  conveyors are not moving the block. The height of the borders is 0

Hi


Is your block a Solid with bounding object and physics?

##### MariusJuston [Moderator] 07/25/2019 15:16:29
yes


the block does move when it is completely on one of the conveyors

##### Fabien Rohrer [Moderator] 07/25/2019 15:18:25
Could you monitor the contact points (View / Optional Rendering / Show Contact Points) and tell if there are always 2 blue rectangles, one on each conveyor belt?

##### MariusJuston [Moderator] 07/25/2019 15:19:44
At the beginning there are the two rectangles but then they disappear


They probably disappeared becasue the contact points did not change

##### Fabien Rohrer [Moderator] 07/25/2019 15:23:40
mmm, normally they should remain even if they do not change


let me check something..

##### MariusJuston [Moderator] 07/25/2019 15:24:09
okay


Here is a video of it happening if it helps

Could you set the 2 Conveyor.borderHeight to -0.05 ?

##### MariusJuston [Moderator] 07/25/2019 15:26:19
It works now

##### Fabien Rohrer [Moderator] 07/25/2019 15:26:24
oh really?

##### MariusJuston [Moderator] 07/25/2019 15:27:10
That is strange becasue when I put -1 to test if it was the borders it was telling me: `WARNING: DEF ConveyorBelt Robot > ConveyorBelt (PROTO) > Group > Transform > Box: Invalid 'size' changed to 1 1 1. The value should be positive.`

##### Fabien Rohrer [Moderator] 07/25/2019 15:27:23

Ok, the borderHeight should be smaller than the size.y value. A better warning is missing there.

Is there, when taking the video of the current animation to made the custom robot window included into the video as well?

Are you speaking of the robot window ?

Yes, sorry I meant the robot window

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 07/25/2019 15:55:41
I am sorry but this is not possible in video. But you can either:

  - Use a display which overlay is visible in the video.

  - Use an external tool to record a movie from your screen

##### MariusJuston [Moderator] 07/25/2019 15:57:40
That is shame, but still thank you

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 07/25/2019 15:58:50
That would be indeed a nice feature, unfortunately, since  the robot window is in the controller process this would be difficult to implement. You're welcome

##### MariusJuston [Moderator] 07/25/2019 16:03:21
Would it be possible to find the current robot window instances and then when recording be able to select one of the open tab, then during the recording it saves the robot window view as an image and appends it to the right or left of the simulation view frame?

##### Fabien Rohrer [Moderator] 07/25/2019 16:30:15
The generic robot window is defined here: [https://github.com/omichel/webots/tree/revision/resources/projects/plugins/robot\_windows/generic](https://github.com/omichel/webots/tree/revision/resources/projects/plugins/robot_windows/generic)

Hi Berethore


Did you follow our the tutorial?

[https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/tutorials](https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/tutorials)


If not I strongly recommend to do tutorial 1-7, you will learn how to design new object (including some with joints)

##### Huey 07/26/2019 13:22:57
Hi, I try to change the RectangleArena into a plain color. So, I made a copy of the RectangleArena.proto and 'save as' a different file under my project protos folder. 



Subsequently, I created new proto file, MatteGreyConcrete.proto  in Webots\projects\appearances\protos

then change: field SFNode     floorAppearance to MatteGreyConcrete {} inside the new RectangleArena.proto file



 That s when i get the error message: /protos/RectangleArenaPlain.proto':14:36: error: Skipped unknown 'MatteGreyConcrete' node or PROTO.


May I asked if that's not allowed? Or any other way i could change the floor texture map into a plain color?

##### Fabien Rohrer [Moderator] 07/26/2019 13:24:39
This is possible, you should be close from a solution. Did you put your new file in the "protos" directory?


YOUR\_PROJECT/protos/MatteGreyConcrete.proto?

##### Huey 07/26/2019 13:26:54
Oh i didn't, instead I put the MatteGreyConcrete.proto in the Webots\projects\appearances\protos

##### Fabien Rohrer [Moderator] 07/26/2019 13:27:35
It should work too.


Did you rename the proto name inside the MatteGreyConcrete.proto ?


By the way, your solution seems quite complexe. Instead of creating a PROTO for this, you could simply use the PBRAppearance node:


RectangleArena.floorAppearance PBRAppearance { baseColor 1 0 0}

##### Huey 07/26/2019 13:33:18
LOL... indeed... doi me


I was fidgeting with the floorAppearance and somehow got sucked into the blackhole


your solution is much more straightforward, i wll use that


however, i did the changing filename too, but still getting this error msg: v14:36: error: Skipped unknown 'MatteGreyConcrete' node or PROTO.

##### Fabien Rohrer [Moderator] 07/26/2019 13:36:22
the PROTO name should match with the filename.


Inside the .proto file, you need to change the name too:


PROTO nameEqualsToFileName [ field ... ]

sir, i have modified the code that you have given and now i am getting the desired action by robot. 

But i am getting one problem that when i am trying to add turn left or turn right motion in the same file.

it is taking only one command

either it is goiing forward or turning left 

why so sir??


i added the below code, it is not showing any error, the file compiled successfully



but when i  am putting the turn left movement above the forward movement the robot is only taking the turning left command.



and when i am putting the forward command above the turn left command it is only taking the forward command

why sir?

I have added a cone shape point (touching the ground) (a polulu ball caster like device would have been ideal, but might be complex to build?)

Is it possible to set boundingObject to take more than one Shape?

Could you give more description about what the code is supposed to do, what robot there, etc... please just giving the error is not very helpful

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 07/29/2019 06:41:04
`@Huey`, `@MariusJuston` is completely right, you should use a group, please have a look at this tutorial showing something very similar: [https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/tutorial-5-compound-solid-and-physics-attributes-15-minutes](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/tutorial-5-compound-solid-and-physics-attributes-15-minutes)


Note also that to prevent the robot from swaying during motion we ususally use a sphere(which can be partially 'inside' the robot) this is more efficient to simulate, and we set the ContactProperties.coulombFriction to a very low value to make the contact between the sphere and the ground frictionless ([https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/contactproperties](https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/contactproperties))

##### Huey 07/29/2019 06:49:46
Thanks `@MariusJuston` , like you said, I added 'group' instead of 'shape' and playing with it a little bit, and slowly understand what you mean!

##### Stefania Pedrazzi [cyberbotics] 07/29/2019 09:54:21
`@Deleted User` you have to wait until the first motion is over before starting the next one, otherwise the second motion commands will overwrite the first one.

Please look at the `wbu_motion_is_over` documentation: [https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/motion#wbu\_motion\_is\_over](https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/motion#wbu_motion_is_over)

here is also a sample controller showing how to use it: [https://github.com/omichel/webots/blob/revision/projects/robots/softbank/nao/controllers/nao\_wave\_hand/nao\_wave\_hand.c](https://github.com/omichel/webots/blob/revision/projects/robots/softbank/nao/controllers/nao_wave_hand/nao_wave_hand.c)

while (true) {

    // Wait until the Up key is pushed

    while (wb\_robot\_step(time\_step) != -1) {

      if (wb\_keyboard\_get\_key() == WB\_KEYBOARD\_UP)

        break; // stop waiting

    }



    // Run the simulator while the motion is not over.

    wbu\_motion\_play(forwards);  // Start the walk motion.



    do {

      double time = wb\_robot\_get\_time(); // get the simulated time in seconds.

      wb\_motor\_set\_position(RShoulderPitch, 1.2 + 0.3 * sin(-5.0 * time)); // move the elbow according to a sinusoidal function.

      wb\_motor\_set\_position(LShoulderPitch, (1.2 + 0.3 * sin(5.0 * time)));

      wb\_robot\_step(time\_step);

    } while (! wbu\_motion\_is\_over(forwards));

  }

  

  return 0;

}


here i have given wbu motion is over command for forward motion



where should i add the turn left command

##### Stefania Pedrazzi [cyberbotics] 07/29/2019 10:17:57
to turn left after going forward you have to add it just after the `do..while`. 

But I strongly suggest you to try to understand your code and play with it by moving the instructions at different position in the code and see what happens.

##### Deleted User 07/29/2019 10:19:08
so you are saying agin i have to give a while loop after   } while (! wbu\_motion\_is\_over(forwards));

##### Stefania Pedrazzi [cyberbotics] 07/29/2019 10:21:00
yes. from `wbu_motion_play` to `while (! wbu_motion_is_over(forwards))` you are running the forward motion. To run the turn left you have to execute the same instructions.

##### Deleted User 07/29/2019 10:41:56
it is working sir



but now one problem arises

when I am pressing the forward motion after that only the turn left command is working and it is working for the single time only

and if i need to turn it more i have to first go forward then only turning command is working


`@Stefania Pedrazzi`


`@Fabien Rohrer` sir please guide me.

how can i add more motions in the code you have sent me



actually when i am doing it is taking one command only.



now as stefania sir guided 



it is working but now it is working as i send the above message

##### Stefania Pedrazzi [cyberbotics] 07/29/2019 11:36:03
`@Deleted User` note that what you have now it is a generic programming issue not depending on Webots. You have all the resources needed to execute the Webots commands and move the robot. You just have to structure your code correctly. To write Webots controller programs it is requried to have some programming knowledge. If you struggle with it you may also consider following some programming tutorials.

Yes


Oh wait I know the issue


It is a code issue. Please remove the `extends Robot`


Save and build the controller and it should work


Or instead of removing `extends Robot` you can remove the `Robot robot = new Robot();` and then remove all instances off `robot.SOMETHING` and replace it with `this.SOMETHING` or just `SOMETHING`, either of the options would work

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 07/30/2019 06:50:05
Thank you for the file. The problem is that you are getting the value of the touch-sensor at the first step only, you should move the line `tForce=ts.getValue();` in the while loop, just before the print:


```java
  public void run2()
  {
    while(this.step(TIME_STEP)!=1)
    {    
      tForce=ts.getValue();
      System.out.println(" "+tForce);      
    
      double leftSpeed=1.0;
      double rightSpeed=1.0;
      
      if (tForce>0)
      {
        leftSpeed = -2.0;
        rightSpeed= -2.0;
      }
      wheels[0].setVelocity(leftSpeed);
      wheels[1].setVelocity(rightSpeed);    
    }
  }
```

##### Berethore 07/30/2019 06:53:51
Hi every body. I have some issues with connector... I'm trying to use your Connector interface. I'm taking the exemple you provide in Webots. But i'm trying to connect a robotic arm to a random object (a box here), nothing happenned. I put the code in my controller, i have the autoLock at True, et the model is the same for both connector... I have no idea what's wrong.. Can i have your help pls ?

##### Fabien Rohrer [Moderator] 07/30/2019 06:54:28
Hi, yes sure.


Basically, you need to add a Connector in the arm end effector, and in your object.


You need to align them correctly.


And set their fields correctly.


The alignment may be a source of issue, it's certainly the first thing to check.


Please look at this figure: [https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/connector#connector-axis-system](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/connector#connector-axis-system)

##### Berethore 07/30/2019 06:56:57
I'm trying to align them perfectly while the simulation isn't running to see if it's working, but when i run again the simulation after that, still nothing


Ooh.. Maybe is it a problem about axis

##### Fabien Rohrer [Moderator] 07/30/2019 06:57:55
the positive z-axis of the connectors should face each other


and the y axis should match


Could you check/fix this first?


We could look at the parameters together when we are sure this is correct..

##### Berethore 07/30/2019 07:01:06
Ok my axis match but still nothing.

##### Fabien Rohrer [Moderator] 07/30/2019 07:01:27
Ok, that's a good step.


What do you want to achieve exactly? To automatically snap the objects at step 0?


i.e. at the beginning of the simulation?

##### Huey 07/30/2019 07:02:30
oh.. that s why. Thanks so much `@David Mansolino`, it looks like it s working, however, it seems like im only getting negligible readings in the beginning, so i thought maybe the box too 'light', I increase the size (mass), and im still getting 0.0, is it bcz the robot itself is too small?

##### Berethore 07/30/2019 07:03:21
For a preliminary test, yes. But the final goal is to grasp object with specific interface


But if i can just make it working at step 0, it could be a good point

##### Fabien Rohrer [Moderator] 07/30/2019 07:04:01
yes, indeed, it's a good starting point. let me check something..


`@Berethore` I'm trying to do an example of this.

##### Berethore 07/30/2019 07:09:19
Ok, that's very nice, thank you.

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 07/30/2019 07:09:51
`@Huey`, that's normal the force sensor meseaure external forces applied to the object, the mass/size of the object itself doesn't matter, try pushing your robot against a wall/obstacle in that case you will see the value increasing.

##### Fabien Rohrer [Moderator] 07/30/2019 07:33:04
`@Berethore` Here I am üòÉ

##### Berethore 07/30/2019 07:33:44
So do I !

##### Fabien Rohrer [Moderator] 07/30/2019 07:34:06
I tried to do that on an ABB arm:

Here is the world:

I set the connectors like this:


Arm connector:



Connector {

  locked TRUE

  type "active"

  isLocked TRUE

  autoLock TRUE

}





Solid connector:



Connector {

  type "passive"

}


You should pay attention to:


- it is required to have a Solid parent with physics and bounding object in the each parents of the connectors


- the distanceTolerance may be increased to be sure you are in the correct threshold

##### Huey 07/30/2019 07:37:22
Good to know. Thanks `@David Mansolino` for helping to solve this problem üòÑ

##### Fabien Rohrer [Moderator] 07/30/2019 07:37:45
- you can display the connector axis in View / Optional Rendering / Show Connector Axes


You have certainly all what you need to solve your issue now (?)

##### Huey 07/30/2019 07:38:33
Another question, may i know why when the robot pushes against something very heavy, the reading falls flat (0.0) again?

##### Berethore 07/30/2019 07:38:57
Ok thanks a lot ! I think i can solve my issue with all your information now yes ! Thanks again üòÉ

##### Fabien Rohrer [Moderator] 07/30/2019 07:39:18
Don't hesitate to come back later if it's not the case üòâ

##### Berethore 07/30/2019 07:41:02
Ok thanks üòÉ

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 07/30/2019 07:45:14
`@Huey`, you can define the response of the sensor in its lookup table ([https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/touchsensor](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/touchsensor)) in any case make sure that the robot is still pushing agains the obstacle (you can for example verify that there are still some contact points using the view menu: [https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/the-user-interface#view-menu](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/the-user-interface#view-menu) )

##### Berethore 07/30/2019 09:27:44
Hi again `@Fabien Rohrer` , don't want to bother you, but when i'm looking at your example, i have some questions :



 - How can I control the connector ? I made a new controller in your world, got the device, used the enable\_presence fonction and tried to unlock with the fonction in the loop. But nothing happenned.



- Same thing when i just put the isLocked boolean false, the box still is connected to the robot. Is it normal ?



- I would like to know if there are many things to change to get symetric connector, or if it's juste the type to change ?

##### Fabien Rohrer [Moderator] 07/30/2019 09:32:02
Connectors which can be lock/unlock programatically needs slightly different fields.


you could refer to this example:


[https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/samples-devices#connector-wbt](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/samples-devices#connector-wbt)


The fields to set are:


Connector {

  model "magnetic"

  autoLock TRUE

}


(other fields are implicitly set to their default values)


Once this is done, you should explicitly call the wb\_connector\_lock() function to lock the Connector.

##### Berethore 07/30/2019 09:38:19
I did that. I added magnetic to the field model for both connector, same for the autoLock at True. I changed isLocked to be False (want to try to lock it with the controller). And then i wrote this in my controller :
%figure
![unknown.png](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/565154703139405824/605695662482259968/unknown.png)
%end


But still , the box just fall


Here is my Connector fields. (Same for the connector on the robot but with type = active) :
%figure
![unknown.png](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/565154703139405824/605696143124463805/unknown.png)
%end

##### Fabien Rohrer [Moderator] 07/30/2019 09:40:54
It seems very correct to me.


the connector.wbt example mentionned above works with these parameters.


maybe except the box is a Robot and the type is passive..


let me check in another example..

##### Berethore 07/30/2019 09:43:10
Ok i got it, the problem is about my way to launch the controller i think

##### Fabien Rohrer [Moderator] 07/30/2019 09:44:17
Great, nice to read this!

##### Berethore 07/30/2019 09:46:44
That was only a librairies problem.. Damn, i'm sure what i did before would have worked too.... He can't load shared libraries libController.so

##### Fabien Rohrer [Moderator] 07/30/2019 09:48:07
haha, no problems, you're welcome

##### Berethore 07/30/2019 09:49:01
Can't we just open the controller from webots ? We have to run it from terminal ?

##### Fabien Rohrer [Moderator] 07/30/2019 09:51:10
No sure to understand... Webots launches its controllers as child processes. Webots can be launched from the terminal.

##### Berethore 07/30/2019 09:56:11
Ok just forget that, was a dumb question, i could answer it myself (what i actually did). Thanks for all your information. Webots is a very great environment and you are doing a great work with it and with the community üòÉ

##### Marcey 07/30/2019 12:53:03
Hello everybody, I have question: I am using Webots with ROS but I am new to both of them. I want to use the supervisor function to change the translation of my robot using the terminal. I believe it should work with "rosservice call /mybot/supervisor/field/set\_vec3f [service-args]" but I'm struggeling with the service-arguments. Can you help me with that? Or is this a completly wrong way? üòÑ

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 07/30/2019 12:54:23
Hi `@Marcey`, you can find a complete list of the service type here: [http://docs.ros.org/melodic/api/webots\_ros/html/index-msg.html](http://docs.ros.org/melodic/api/webots_ros/html/index-msg.html)


And in the supervisor doeumentation: [https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/supervisor?tab=ros#wb\_supervisor\_field\_set\_sf\_vec3f](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/supervisor?tab=ros#wb_supervisor_field_set_sf_vec3f)

##### Huey 07/30/2019 12:55:20
thanks again  `@David Mansolino` , i gave a look on the documentation on touch sensor again to investigate the weird reading my robot is getting, and i realize that my coordinate z was not pointing towards the solid object, hence, when the robot is no longer pushing ahead further, the reading become 0. my bad.

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 07/30/2019 12:56:07
`@Huey` that seems indeed a very good explanation. thank you for the feedback!

##### Marcey 07/30/2019 13:08:33
`@David Mansolino` thanks, so it says:

"uint64 field

int32 index

geometry\_msgs/Vector3 value" 

How do I translate this to a correct command line in the terminal? What are my values for field and index?

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 07/30/2019 13:11:34
`@Marcey` , index does not really matter if you want to change the translation field (just set it to 0) and 'field' is the id of the field (you can get it with the '/supervisor/node/get\_field' function/service: [https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/supervisor?tab=ros#wb\_supervisor\_node\_get\_field](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/supervisor?tab=ros#wb_supervisor_node_get_field))

##### Marcey 07/30/2019 13:34:21
hm, for this service I need a value of the 'node'. How do I get that? "rosservice call /mybot/supervisor/node/get\_field 0 translation" crashes my controller. And does the ID of the field always stay the same or does ist change?

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 07/30/2019 13:41:01
You first need to get the node id: [https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/supervisor?tab=ros#wb\_supervisor\_node\_get\_from\_def](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/supervisor?tab=ros#wb_supervisor_node_get_from_def)


Probably before trying to use Supervisor Services you should get familiar with the Supervisor API, I would strongly recommend to read the Supervisor documentation: [https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/supervisor](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/supervisor)

And have a look at this example (including the code): [https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/samples-devices#supervisor-wbt](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/samples-devices#supervisor-wbt)

##### Marcey 07/30/2019 14:49:05
Ah ok, I finally was successfull üòÉ Thank you! My problem was to transfer the information in the supervisor API into a correct command line. 



Today I also learned that using the terminal to change the position is propably not practical because node handle and field handle change every time webots is restarted. I'll try to find an other way

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 07/30/2019 15:36:01
Very good news, thank you for the feedback. Indeed you probably need to write a ROS node instead of using the command line.

##### Yang Chen 07/30/2019 17:20:28
Hello is there someone who simulate robots walking in sandy environment? Thank you!

##### MariusJuston [Moderator] 07/30/2019 17:22:05
Like do you mean having sandy properties or just looks like sand?

##### Yang Chen 07/30/2019 17:23:18
Sandy properties. Like robot is  walking in beach.

##### MariusJuston [Moderator] 07/30/2019 17:26:55
That is harder I do not know if Webots can do it, I believe that there are ways to change the surface in the contact surface property field


Maybe look at the bb 8 example


[https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/bb8](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/bb8)

##### Yang Chen 07/30/2019 17:33:35
Thank you so much! I will try and learn soon.


Yes, that is what I am considering now. I saw the moon DEMO of Wevots and try to see if it can mimic the real moon contact properties when mimic  robots is moving on moon.    While "texCoord TextureCoordinate {

      point [ "    of    " the geometry IndexedFaceSet {

    coord DEF coord\_Plane Coordinate"     in the "moon.wbt " , there are so many cordinates, I am wondering is there other ways to input the cordinates instead  of  printing it in nodes.

##### MariusJuston [Moderator] 07/30/2019 17:35:07
You can  just copy the index face set and then paste

##### Yang Chen 07/30/2019 17:49:52
Do you mean copying and pasting them like this?

##### MariusJuston [Moderator] 07/30/2019 17:50:59
Click and then press CTRl c on the cord def


And then you can paste is somewhere else

##### Yang Chen 07/30/2019 17:58:18
Hi  MariusJuston, thank you for your kind help. I am wondering do you mean copy one cord and paste it one by one? My question seems so absurd and easy. The reason why I am asking it is if we copy every coor and paste it on nodes like the above picture I showed you, it will be a little time consuming and easy to make mistakes. So I am wondering if I am wrong, maybe there exists other methods that I do not know.

##### MariusJuston [Moderator] 07/31/2019 04:31:20
`@Yang Chen` Sorry for the delay. A simple way to do all this, if you want to just reuse the same GROUND shape is to Export that Shape/Solid. To do this you can left click the Shape/Solid and then select the Export button, this will save the information to a .wbo, to re import this .wbo you can just press the Add button and the press Import (bottom right corner ), find your .wbo and you should see the Shape/Solid appear in the tree directory. If you want to move it around you can `Ctrl + X` (Cut) and then `Ctrl + V` (Paste) it in the location you want it to be; however, please be aware that you cannot place a Shape/Solid everywhere so if `Ctrl + V` fails you can probably assume that that is the reason.  



If you just want to copy the coordinates, you can select, the `point` field in the tree view and then `Ctrl + C` it, if you want to verify that it copied, you can open up notepad and the paste your clipboard there, if there is text then you are good. Once you have copied the points you can go to your new `Coordinate` node, select the point node and the press the delete button on your keyboard, all the points in the `point` should disappear, select `point` and then press `Ctrl + V`. You should see all the points that you copied appear in the `point` field

##### Huey 07/31/2019 11:54:35
Hi `@MariusJuston`  i find your reply to yang chen relevant to a problem i may have too. I am working on a decentralize system, and currently creating a small and abstract experiment on number of homogeneous robots to collaborate on a task. I use 'solid' to represent 'obstacle' needs to be cleared. And when i have too many of those (video), webot would tell me that the 'complicated world' might affect accuracy of calculation.



May i know using the export/import method, does it create a replica/will it reference a link to the source? Thank you

##### MariusJuston [Moderator] 07/31/2019 11:59:02
Using the export/import method I believe that it will just create a replica

##### Fabien Rohrer [Moderator] 07/31/2019 11:59:48
Not sure if this helps, but there are several ways to avoid duplicating nodes:


- the DEF-USE mechanism allows to duplicate a node within some context (in a .wbt file, or in a .proto file): [https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/def-and-use](https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/def-and-use)


- proto can be contain LUA scripts (containing for example for loops): [https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/procedural-proto-nodes](https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/procedural-proto-nodes)

##### MariusJuston [Moderator] 07/31/2019 12:04:21
`@Huey` if you keep the base solid node and then create a bunch of Transforms, then in the each of the transforms use the DEF and USE method to have it so that the solid is not duplicated and just reused and translated to different place. Maybe, I do not remember if transforms can handle solids

##### Fabien Rohrer [Moderator] 07/31/2019 12:05:31
It's better to avoid to put solids in transforms, but a pattern could be:


Solid {

  translation 0 0 0

  name "solid 1"

  children [

    Shape DEF MY\_SHAPE {

      appearance PBRAppearance {}

      geometry Box {}

    }

  ]

  boundingObject USE MY\_SHAPE

  physics DEF MY\_PHYSICS Physics {}

}

Solid {

  translation 0 0 1

  name "solid 2"

  children [

    Shape USE MY\_SHAPE

  ]

  boundingObject USE MY\_SHAPE

  physics USE MY\_PHYSICS

}

Solid {

  translation 0 0 2

  name "solid 3"

  children [

    Shape USE MY\_SHAPE

  ]

  boundingObject USE MY\_SHAPE

  physics USE MY\_PHYSICS

}


You can even be more concise using the procedural templates. Look at the SimpleStair example here: [https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/procedural-proto-nodes#example](https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/procedural-proto-nodes#example)

##### Huey 07/31/2019 12:16:33
Oh splendid! Thanks so much for sharing these `@MariusJuston`,  `@Fabien Rohrer`, earlier i was abt confused with the DEF use, as i dont always find the DEF i created, but will sure to take a second look on the documentation and other methods you have mentioned! Double thumbs up to you guys üëç  üëç

##### Yang Chen 07/31/2019 14:31:40
Hi, `@MariusJuston` , thank you for kind help! And give me suggestion in detail.

%end

##### Fabien Rohrer [Moderator] 07/31/2019 14:48:57
To be honest Webots is not very good to create meshes.


We used to work with 3D modeling software, especially Blender


I wrote a Blender add-on to export Webots objects: [https://github.com/omichel/blender-webots-exporter](https://github.com/omichel/blender-webots-exporter)


.. but this requires to have skills in Blender and modeling unfortunately.


You could also simply work with basic primitives:


[https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/samples-geometries#geometric\_primitives-wbt](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/samples-geometries#geometric_primitives-wbt)

##### Yang Chen 07/31/2019 14:52:42
While it is worthy of it, maybe it is useful and can save time in  long run. In addition, does Solidworks and CAD make sense?


`@Fabien Rohrer` Thank you for your kind help and so many materials provided! üëè

##### Fabien Rohrer [Moderator] 07/31/2019 14:55:03
SolidWorks and other CADs are generally exporting very big meshes, hardly usable directly in Webots. Moreover, physics data (joints, etc.) are lost in this operation. Therefore, using Blender inbetween is for sure the simplest solution.

##### Yang Chen 07/31/2019 15:00:12
As you are familiar with Blender combined with our Webots, could you tell me can Blender build hexapod robots,like those in the picture.

the thing is I want to build hexapod robots like those in pictures, and then simulate hexapod robots walking in beach which contains sandy properties by Webots.


Is it ok for me to realize it?

##### Fabien Rohrer [Moderator] 07/31/2019 15:02:32
Yes, for sure. We have several legged-robots, and most of the time, we modeled their meshes and materials in Blender before migrating to Webots for the physics and robotics simulation.


We have an hexapod model here: [https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/mantis](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/mantis)


.. and your robot is close to this robot look, size and hardware: [https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/bioloid](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/bioloid)


I think that you can already go far using Webots only. I recommend you to do our tutorial, you will learn there how to create a robot with Webots basic geometric primitives:


[https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/tutorials](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/tutorials)


I have also to mention that we can model this for you if you have some budget for this.

##### Yang Chen 07/31/2019 15:28:56
Thank you! The hexiapod robot in your samples is really amazing and it could be control by human being ! I need a small one, about 0.5m l,  0.5m w and 0.3m h for robots' whole size and the shape should be like my physical robot.   Can I revise yours based on my physical robot?

##### Fabien Rohrer [Moderator] 07/31/2019 15:33:45
Feel free to choose your best solution üòÉ


Downscaling a robot may be tricky.


personnally, I would go for the solution to rewrite it from scratch using the Webots primitives, and to copy the mantis controller.

##### Yang Chen 07/31/2019 15:35:54
Also, how do you ( specialist) in webots  deal with the sandy properties environtment? I saw the contact properties setting. I am wondering can it realize the real scene in our real world that when a robot is walking in beach while the mutual impact bettween sand and robot's feet influence both the state of sand and robot, like the particle dynamics.


Really a good idea! üòÄ  I learned the tutorials, and built a simple hexapod robot.


And the budget depends on my advisor.


I mean my teacher.

##### Fabien Rohrer [Moderator] 07/31/2019 15:41:50
You could contact sales@cyberbotics.com with precise robot specs to have a quote if you would like to go on. I think such kind of robot could be done in about 1 week of development.


About the sandy environment, you can model this quite precisely I think.


At least, you can set up precisely how the robot feet penetrate the ground.


To do that, first fix the WorldInfo.basicTimeStep (I would say something like 8 ms)


.. and then play with the ContactProperties.softERP and ContactProperties.softCFM (for the contact between the feet and the sand only).


You should be able to define precisely at which depth the robot shrinks.


For sure it's not a perfect deformation simulation, but it gives already a good approximation.

##### Yang Chen 07/31/2019 15:57:21
Get it!  Thank you so much for your kind help and professional instruction!  And Webots are really good!


`@Fabien Rohrer` While the problem is that the I can not  define or set up precisely at which depth the robot shrinks, as this is what I plan to export or obtain from Webots.  And are there any idea about it?

##### Fabien Rohrer [Moderator] 07/31/2019 16:43:02
Did you tried to play with ContactProperties.softERP/CFM? That‚Äôs the key to set the shrink depth.


[https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/contactproperties](https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/contactproperties)

##### Yang Chen 07/31/2019 17:05:08
Thank you üòÄ ! I will try. And if it is needed, I will contact sales@cyberbotics.com.

##### MariusJuston [Moderator] 07/31/2019 18:42:17
`@Yang Chen` sorry being late for the party but on the topic of adding CADed models to Webots what you can is that you can export your CAD as a .obj or an .stl (make sure the scaling is set to meters) then open blender, import the .stl or .obj, then install the adding that `@Fabien Rohrer` made. After importing be sure that the orientation of the object is correct to make sure, to change it select the model and the the plus button the right, that will open up a window where you can select set the orientation. Using the Addin you can the press the export button and then export to a .wbl file not a .wbt

##### Yang Chen 07/31/2019 21:00:45
`@MariusJuston` Hi , welcome party.  it begins. I am studying the Mantis now, while the controller is using this function to control the motor's position.

Can you explain why should we use this function? Does it relate to Central Pattern Generator?

##### MariusJuston [Moderator] 07/31/2019 21:04:20
To be honest I am not very versed in what the Central Pattern Generator is, but I am assuming that is to make it so that that the robot always has enough points of contact to the ground in order to stay stable and still allows the robot to move forwards.

##### Yang Chen 07/31/2019 21:05:54
Of course, I agree with you. And Central Pattern Generator can realize it. So ...


Then, could you tell me the meaning of "M\_PI" in this fuction

##### MariusJuston [Moderator] 07/31/2019 21:07:09
Oh that is the the PI constant so that is equivalent to 3.14....


[https://stackoverflow.com/questions/15231466/whats-the-difference-between-pi-and-m-pi-in-objc](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/15231466/whats-the-difference-between-pi-and-m-pi-in-objc)


the a[i] is the amplitude of the motion, the 2 PI f is the frequency and p[i] is the phase shift

##### Yang Chen 07/31/2019 21:12:52
Thank you ! this is really clear.  So how do you adjust or choose the amplitude, phase, offset

##### MariusJuston [Moderator] 07/31/2019 21:14:13
So I am assuming that you are the one that define the a, p and d arrays and f constant so you just have to change those values

##### Yang Chen 07/31/2019 21:19:40
Yep. Does this controller  realize the tripod gait on this vedio

##### MariusJuston [Moderator] 07/31/2019 21:21:23
Oh, I did not know Webots had already implemented this, like me follow along with you. What is the tripod gait?


I do not believe that it does just that but something similar, but do not quote me on that


Actually yes it does do the tripod gait in that video


Wow it really is impressive how it requires so little code to it make look so complex!

##### Yang Chen 07/31/2019 21:30:54
Yep. I see you are moderator. Are you belongs to  cyberbotics?


`@Fabien Rohrer` could you teach us  the  Mantis controller function here.

No, I just joined Discord like a month ago because I had a question about Webots and after working with Webots, learning about it for a month and helping people I managed to become a Moderator üòâ

##### Yang Chen 07/31/2019 21:35:34
Congratulations!

##### MariusJuston [Moderator] 07/31/2019 21:36:35
Thanks

##### Yang Chen 07/31/2019 21:36:58
What is  your project  with Webots?

##### MariusJuston [Moderator] 07/31/2019 21:38:21
It involved using an industrial robot Fanuc M-710iC


We managed to convert the CAD model of the industrial robot into Webots

##### Yang Chen 07/31/2019 21:39:44
and then?

##### MariusJuston [Moderator] 07/31/2019 21:40:34
We were able to make the robot move to and from positions using inverse kinematics, etc... Sorry I do not know how far into detail I can go with this.

##### Yang Chen 07/31/2019 21:40:59
I would do this too, and thank you again for your kind instruction before.

##### MariusJuston [Moderator] 07/31/2019 21:41:09
No problems

##### Yang Chen 07/31/2019 21:41:34
I mean the  CAD model of the  hixapod robot into Webots

##### MariusJuston [Moderator] 07/31/2019 21:42:00
Did you manage?

##### Yang Chen 07/31/2019 21:42:08
by using Blender


I am planning to do it  in the near future.


Can you give me some suggestion , website etc. ?

##### MariusJuston [Moderator] 07/31/2019 21:44:15
If you want I can create a video of me converting the CAD model of the robot into a Webots model? (I only have Autodesk Inventor though)

##### Yang Chen 07/31/2019 21:46:54
You are so nice! I am very willing to see your video, if it is convenient for you.

##### MariusJuston [Moderator] 07/31/2019 21:47:55
No problems it should not take very long, which version of Blender do you have? Blender just updated to 2.80 and it seems that the Export to .wrl that `@Fabien Rohrer` created no longer appears...

##### Yang Chen 07/31/2019 21:50:41
which version are you using now?

##### MariusJuston [Moderator] 07/31/2019 21:51:23
I was using 2.79, I believe. Do not worry about it I will show you in the video everything

##### Yang Chen 07/31/2019 21:53:46
Thank you so much! the version that is convenient for you  is ok for me.  Then I can setup the same one as you.

##### MariusJuston [Moderator] 07/31/2019 21:54:06
I will show you how to do it in the video, if you want

##### Yang Chen 07/31/2019 21:56:33

##### MariusJuston [Moderator] 08/01/2019 14:10:12
`@Fabien Rohrer` Actually I think that we do not use your Webots addon due to the fact that it does not actually export a *.wrl but a *.wrt


Blender 2.7* has an VRML97 (*.wrl) exporter by default


`@Olivier Michel` I do not know if you remember but previously I was trying to get Webots to run through PyCharm; however, the program stopped at the import statement because it had a `ImportError: DLL load failed error`. You tried to help me; however we did not manage to solve the issue even though I had all the environmental variables setup. You said that you were going to try it on PyCharm; however you were on your trip to China so you had to do it later. I was wondering if you had tried?

##### NERanger 08/02/2019 15:04:01
I am running a simulatoin for a 4WD tractor, how can I get the support force from the ground to the wheel? The return value of function "dBodyGetForce" is only valid until any changes are made, but there is no need to add any force, I only want to check the support force. Can anyone help me out plz üòÉ

##### Yang Chen 08/03/2019 15:23:09
Hi `@MariusJuston`,  your Youtube Video are very helpful and clear! As I use the Solidework 3D model - your method is also useful!

##### MariusJuston [Moderator] 08/03/2019 15:23:37
No problems glad I was able to help!

##### Yang Chen 08/03/2019 15:24:57
Thank you for kind share!


While I face up with a problem about the scale and coordinates,when imported it in Webots. I am not sure if it is due to the  Solidework 3D model ,  as I see you introduce we need transform function in Blenders in your vedio.


I am wondering do you face up with these kind of situation befor? I plan to try the transform and unit you teach us in your vedio. As I my  Solidework 3D model  is finished by my partner.  Maybe I need to communicate with him about these problem to find out the reason. And can you give me some suggestion?

##### MariusJuston [Moderator] 08/03/2019 18:48:55
`@Yang Chen` sorry about that. So when you imported the file as into blender did it show up as being huge?


The problem is probably the scaling I said inside the video Webots only takes in meters, so if you export your file in inches or mm you will see your model, when imported into Blender being way too large. To fix this either you can export your solid work file directly in the correct units (meters) which is the easiest way of doing it (I have no real idea as to how you would do it in Solidwords because I do not have it). Or you can, when you are exporting the file using blender, when you are asked where to save the file, on the left you can see a scale text bar, make it so that it return current units to meter scale. i.e if it was in inches it would be (1 m /39.3701 inches)  or 0.0254


`@NERanger`  I do not know if you know but  [https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/touchsensor](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/touchsensor) has a force mode that can allow it to measure force or touch

`@MariusJuston`, unfortunately `@omichel` was very very busy last week and he is now on holiday, but he will probably try when he will be back at the end of the week (do not hesitate to re-ask him üòâ )


`@NERanger` , the solution with touch-sensors that `@MariusJuston` suggested is indeed a good solution, you just need to change the wheels of your vehicles to a TouchSensor node instead of a Solid node and set the 'type' field to "force-3d"


Another alternative that doesn't require to change the hierarchy of your vehicle is to use indeed a physic plugin, and in the `webots_physics_collide` callback ([https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/callback-functions](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/callback-functions)) create a contact joint and attach a joint feedback to retrieve the force at the contact point ([http://ode.org/wiki/index.php?title=Manual#Joint\_feedback](http://ode.org/wiki/index.php?title=Manual#Joint_feedback)).

##### MariusJuston [Moderator] 08/05/2019 14:43:24
`@David Mansolino` I completely understand, I will thus wait for the end of the week when he comes back.

##### Yang Chen 08/06/2019 02:29:32
`@MariusJuston` Thank you so much for your kind suggestion. Sorry reply you late. Recently I am focusing on and would focus on another task. These like multiple lines run. Definitely I would try your idea later.

Hi `@Yang Chen`, these coefficient where found empirically. An easy way to thune them is tu use numerical optimization methods: [https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/using-numerical-optimization-methods](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/using-numerical-optimization-methods)

In addition, I want to understand of this sin function. could you recommend me this gait control's  theory. I think I have trouble with the swing and stance phase control.


Thank you!

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 08/09/2019 16:07:16
`@Yang Chen`, you should probably have a look at 'central pattern generators' (CPG). Here is for example an article about this: [https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0960982201005814](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0960982201005814)

New here, going to check out Webots. Have used Gazebo and vrep for many years in robotics, so a bit excited to see what Webots is about


A small beginner question, is it possible to run Webots on Mac connected to a rosmaster on Ubuntu? Does it require any ros packages compiled on Mac to make this setup work? If not possible, I will keep everything to Ubuntu.

No problems üòâ


`@Fabien Rohrer` for your Blender addon once you have exported your file to a *.wbt how are you supposed to open it in Webots? When I tried to open it using Open World It gave me   `Expected node or PROTO name, found '{'.` and `Failed to load due to syntax error(s).`

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 08/12/2019 06:23:14
Hi `@MariusJuston`, `@Fabien Rohrer` is off for vacation, but I can try to answer for him. The Blender addon should produce .wbt files that you can open directly in Webots. If that doesn't work, please open an issue to report the problem, including your .blend file, so that we can try to reproduce it and better understand what's wrong.

##### Liu 08/12/2019 12:02:31

Can you please try to stasrt Webots in safe mode: [https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/starting-webots#safe-mode](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/starting-webots#safe-mode)

##### Clement 08/12/2019 14:46:50
Hi everyone, I am playing with Webots physics/collision system and I'm facing a weird situation. I have a manipulator arm that I control manually through the Webots interface. When I make the arm push an object against a static object (no physic field), at some point the arm starts passing through the object. I was expecting the arm to be blocked. I tried setting the ERP field to 0 but it doesn't fix it. Is it possible to achieve my goal or is this a limitation from ODE ?

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 08/12/2019 14:48:03
Hi Clement,


Does your static object have a boundingObject?


What do you mean control manually from the Webots interface? If you do that from the scene tree, nothing will prevent you from colliding with objects. You should control your robot from your controller so that the simulation runs and the collision detector works.

##### Clement 08/12/2019 14:52:16
Well the static object is a Robot with no boundingObject but it has children which have boundingBox


I am using the robot window that appears when I double click the robot. It allows me to move the joints individually


Here is a video of the simulation: [https://drive.google.com/file/d/1y7L2c4tgUtV1QFr1IhSEaV874-e8H3C9/view?usp=sharing](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1y7L2c4tgUtV1QFr1IhSEaV874-e8H3C9/view?usp=sharing)

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 08/12/2019 15:04:45
Have you tried decreasing the 'basciTimeStep' ? Or the motor acceleration (bedefault motors have an infinite acceleration)

##### Clement 08/12/2019 15:08:00
I've tried with 16 and 8ms but I haven't seen any difference.

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 08/12/2019 15:10:07
It looks like the force of the motor is too strong...


Can you reduce the maxTorque value of the motor to see whether it helps?

##### Clement 08/12/2019 15:14:59
indeed it was set to 10000!!


It works perfectly if I reduce it. Thanks a lot!

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 08/12/2019 15:16:18
Great.

##### Yang Chen 08/13/2019 15:02:34
Hello! I see the mantis has tripod gait. Could you please show me  the code or other setup which decides when one pair of three feet fix on ground and when one pair of three feet lift the ground?

##### MariusJuston [Moderator] 08/13/2019 15:10:26
`wb_motor_set_position(motors[i], a[i] * sin(2.0 * M_PI * f * time + p[i]) + d[i]);` It is all part of the sinusoidal function, the amplitude tells the legs if it should from left to right or right to left and by how much it should move by

##### Yang Chen 08/13/2019 15:21:40
Hi,`@MariusJuston` Thank you! Yes. While I need a specific one. As I am confusing how  this fuction realizes which pair of feet fix on ground and only rotate the legs and when feet lift while legs rotate. My robot's feet always slip.


So I am trying to totally understand this function. Then, maybe the robot can go normal.

##### MariusJuston [Moderator] 08/13/2019 15:25:00
That is really all based on timing and fine tuning the function. If you look at the graphs of the robot motors while it is running (double click the robot) you will seen the sinusoidal functions and hopefully that helps you

##### Yang Chen 08/13/2019 15:27:30
Thank you so much for your kind suggestion! Yes, of course I will see it now.


Do you mean this link [https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/mantis](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/mantis) ?

Hi,`@MariusJuston` can you see the webots simulation of mantis for a while again. Could you please zoom in the robot walking scenary and see the motion of the feet? When I do this, I find the feet are slipping.

##### MariusJuston [Moderator] 08/13/2019 15:53:11

I am assuming so? I am using the latest R2019b Webots

##### Yang Chen 08/13/2019 16:31:10
I use the same nodes and codes as the github shows, after the matis robot walks for a while I can find feet slipping. Sorry I focus on this point. As the slipping is what I want to eliminate.


Me too.


While the abnormal thing is that when I run real time simulation for the first time. It alwys shows these.

##### MariusJuston [Moderator] 08/13/2019 16:32:59

##### MariusJuston [Moderator] 08/13/2019 16:53:12
That is probably because it is going up the sloped terain

##### Yang Chen 08/13/2019 16:53:27
mine worlds follow this website [https://github.com/omichel/webots/blob/master/projects/robots/micromagic/mantis/worlds/mantis.wbt](https://github.com/omichel/webots/blob/master/projects/robots/micromagic/mantis/worlds/mantis.wbt)


Mine controller follows this websites[https://github.com/omichel/webots/blob/master/projects/robots/micromagic/mantis/controllers/mantis/mantis.c](https://github.com/omichel/webots/blob/master/projects/robots/micromagic/mantis/controllers/mantis/mantis.c)

##### MariusJuston [Moderator] 08/13/2019 16:56:09
Since the motors are set to absolute positions it is forcing the legs to go to those specific positions no matter. This causes it, if there is a slopped terrain to be lift off from the other legs, to fix this you would need to create some kind of suspention on the legs

##### Yang Chen 08/13/2019 16:56:21
how about yours? Do your mantis' simulation has slipping ?


I want to make sure there is no difference between yours and mine.


to escape I am running in the wrong direction.

##### MariusJuston [Moderator] 08/13/2019 17:21:25
It actually does not seem to be slipping


basicTimeStep 10

FPS 60

ERP 0.62

CFM 1e-05


Try reducing the basic time step maybe?


Oh wait I did notice it slipping a little, when it was going downhill, probably due to its mass


You probably want to fiddle with columbFriction in the ContactProperties in order to increase friction. Set the columbFriction to 100 and try it now


Or if you want you can go in the PROTO of the mantis and then set the mass property in the physics node to be 1

##### Yang Chen 08/13/2019 17:33:02
Ok. Thank  you so much for your valuable time and patience!

##### MariusJuston [Moderator] 08/13/2019 17:34:45
That was already set in the sample world so you do not actually need to change those


But if you were to use the mantis in another world you proabbly want to have very similar world settings

##### Yang Chen 08/13/2019 17:36:09
When you are doing your own robot simulation, how do you deal with these parameters, like basicTimeStep 10

FPS 60

ERP 0.62

CFM 1e-05, mass, coefficiency etc.


Just use the our real world's related parameter?

##### MariusJuston [Moderator] 08/13/2019 17:37:06
Usually you do not need to edit them, but if you see some things behave strangely such as objects sinking in ground you probably want to edit them

`@MariusJuston`, I had a bit of time to test PyCharm with Webots, there is a few tricky settings to set, but it seems to work. Can you please try the following:

  1. Open your simulation in pause mode and set the controller of the robot to `<extern>`

  2. in PyCharm select: `File->Settings->Project->Project Structure-> Add Content Root` and select webots/lib/python37 (or any other version), then OK->Apply->OK.

  3. in PyCharm select: `Run->Edit Configurations->Python', Then in the `Environment variables` value add `LD\_LIBRARY\_PATH` (or `PATH` if you are on windows) and set the value to ${WEBOTS_HOME]/lib



Please let me know if you still have any problems with this procedure.

It gave the previous `ImportError: DLL load failed: %1 is not a valid Win32 application.` when I was indeed in a 32 bit  Python 3.7


`@Olivier Michel` I would be really grateful, if you did, thank you! Also `@David Mansolino` many thanks for putting together this web page for Pycharm!


I will try with Python 2. as well

Ok, good news, what is the error message you have now?

##### MariusJuston [Moderator] 08/14/2019 14:31:36
It is the same old `ImportError: DLL load failed: The specified module could not be found.`

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 08/14/2019 14:32:11
Did you install Webots from the installation package on Windows or are you running Webots in the git development environment?

##### MariusJuston [Moderator] 08/14/2019 14:32:47
I have installed Webots from the installation package on Windows

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 08/14/2019 14:35:38
OK, I did the same and it worked for me... Now trying to configure PyCharm to get Python 3.7 running.

##### MariusJuston [Moderator] 08/14/2019 14:35:56
I just tried with Python 2.7 and I still go the error...

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 08/14/2019 14:36:10
The error you get is probably because Webots cannot find the Controller.dll.

##### MariusJuston [Moderator] 08/14/2019 14:36:54
Yes but I can see it in C:\Users\mariu\AppData\Local\Programs\Webots\msys64\mingw64\bin

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 08/14/2019 14:37:06
Maybe you can get more information with 'Debug' insted of 'Run' ?

I am using a Anaconda virtual environment

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 08/14/2019 14:56:26
OK, that seems correct. Are you trying to open the "driver.py" example as in the documenation?

##### MariusJuston [Moderator] 08/14/2019 14:57:09
No I am trying to open my own controller, where is that controller located?

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 08/14/2019 14:57:17
I am not using Anaconda... That's a difference...


In WEBOTS\_HOME\projects\languages\python\controllers\driver

##### MariusJuston [Moderator] 08/14/2019 14:57:58
got it

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 08/14/2019 14:58:58
Can you try without Anaconda (using the standard Python from Python.org)?

##### MariusJuston [Moderator] 08/14/2019 14:59:16
That was just what I was about to try

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 08/14/2019 15:00:01
For Anaconda, you might need to recompile the python libraries as explained here: [https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/using-python#use-an-alternative-python-version](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/using-python#use-an-alternative-python-version). However, it can be tricky...


The safest option is probably to use the standard Python (in a first step).

##### MariusJuston [Moderator] 08/14/2019 15:01:07
It should be fine if I used Python 3.7.4 right?

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 08/14/2019 15:01:36
Yes, I think so.


(beware to get the 64 bit version)

##### MariusJuston [Moderator] 08/14/2019 15:02:50
Yes I made sure to get the 64 bit version this time

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 08/14/2019 15:03:00
I am installing it as well to test it.


I confirm it is working well with Python 3.7.4 from python.org as well.

##### MariusJuston [Moderator] 08/14/2019 15:05:29
Ah, it seem to be working now

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 08/14/2019 15:06:27
Is there any reason why you used Anaconda in the first place?

##### MariusJuston [Moderator] 08/14/2019 15:06:40
To use virtual environments

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 08/14/2019 15:06:49
OK.


So, if you really need Anaconda, you should probably try to recompile the Webots Python libraries with Anaconda as explained here: [https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/using-python#use-an-alternative-python-version](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/using-python#use-an-alternative-python-version)

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 08/15/2019 05:58:33
Hi Juan!


Yes of course, what is your problem?


First, did you read this page?

[https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/using-matlab](https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/using-matlab)

##### Mr. Scruff 08/15/2019 16:26:14
I'm having a terrain problem where the wheels of my virtual tractor keep sinking in the terrain. 

Here is a small video:   [https://agjunction-my.sharepoint.com/:v:/p/mvillela/Ead4Z4TufSBDimFK2IWp-1QBhme0FEhT6Bj1niilwLqCOA?e=4OIt0O](https://agjunction-my.sharepoint.com/:v:/p/mvillela/Ead4Z4TufSBDimFK2IWp-1QBhme0FEhT6Bj1niilwLqCOA?e=4OIt0O)

##### MariusJuston [Moderator] 08/15/2019 16:27:12
Try changing the basic time step to be smaller

##### Mr. Scruff 08/15/2019 16:30:02
Thanks, Marius.   My basic time step is already at 4msec.


But the problem persists.  This happens with the front wheels and with the back wheels.  It is more easily visible when the wheels are spinning at low speeds, as shown in the video.  The problem also appears to not happen in flat terrain.

##### MariusJuston [Moderator] 08/15/2019 16:54:49
Have you tried changing the softCFM in the ContactsProperties


The object is sinking because it is so heavy

##### Mr. Scruff 08/15/2019 16:55:26
I will try that next.  Thank you.


I am reading about softCFM at [https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/worldinfo](https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/worldinfo)

Can you provide more in-depth information?  Perhaps a paper or some other documentation that talks about softCFM in more detail?

##### MariusJuston [Moderator] 08/15/2019 17:08:46
To be honest I am not sure exactly how it works in the backend but I was informed when I had a similar problem of my object sinking in the ground to change the CFM and it seemed to work. From what I can understand from the documentation, imagine that you have a spring (which represents the ground) and the spring constant (k) is represented by the CFM. If you have a high spring constant (lower CFM) it will take more force for it be pressed down, if you have a low spring constant (higher CFM) it will take less force to push the spring down thus causing the object to ‚Äúsink‚Äù in the material. If you do not want the spring be able to sink you would make the spring constant infinity, in this case make the CFM 0.


Hope this helps...

##### Mr. Scruff 08/15/2019 17:14:09
This does help.  I'm curious to see the effects of changing the softCFM.  Thanks again.


Hi `@MariusJuston`.   While the effects of changing the softCFM were clearly visible,  unfortunately it was not able to resolve the issue.  As you can see in the video, the tractor moves fine in certain areas, but very briefly sinks in others.  This effect does not manifest itself in flat terrains.

##### MariusJuston [Moderator] 08/15/2019 21:24:09
Maybe it has something to do with the uneven terrain generator?

##### Mr. Scruff 08/15/2019 22:16:36
I've tried 2 independent terrain generators, but got the same results.   Can you send me a known good terrain so I can test?


Not flat.

Try the terrain that is in the mantis test world

##### aknuclear 08/16/2019 15:52:23

##### Mr. Scruff 08/16/2019 17:30:09
Hi `@MariusJuston` .  I simplified my experiment by using the standard Boomer vehicle, and driving it in the sample terrain that comes with the Clearpath Moose terrain.   Under these conditions, we've been able to duplicate the issue where, at slow speeds, the tractor tires suddenly sink into the ground and then suddenly pop out of the ground.

Given that we are using components that come standard with Webots, without modification, can you reproduce the problem?

[https://agjunction-my.sharepoint.com/:v:/p/mvillela/Ead4Z4TufSBDimFK2IWp-1QBQBMu6c6aIAGeGk50m0D2Ow?e=5jG3Nk](https://agjunction-my.sharepoint.com/:v:/p/mvillela/Ead4Z4TufSBDimFK2IWp-1QBQBMu6c6aIAGeGk50m0D2Ow?e=5jG3Nk)

This new 18 seconds video is a good one.  That left tire slowly sinks and then abruptly pops up again.

##### MariusJuston [Moderator] 08/16/2019 17:47:36
It is also happening on my side...

##### Mr. Scruff 08/16/2019 17:48:16
Glad to hear that.   It appears to only happen close to the connection point between 2 adjacent tiles.

##### MariusJuston [Moderator] 08/16/2019 17:58:50
For me it never behaves exactly how yours does, it never has wheels jumping around... all I did was copy the same WorldInfo as the moose\_demo.wbt and it works, yes the tractor still sinks a little in the ground but it is barely noticeable


Here is my world if you want

##### Mr. Scruff 08/16/2019 19:07:25
Thanks for the .wbt.     I think the reason why it is barely noticeable when you tried it is because you need to run it at slower speeds, like 0.1 kph.   Can you run at these low speeds?   We tried the world you provided and the problem is there, just like in all the other worlds that we've tried so far.

##### MariusJuston [Moderator] 08/18/2019 20:01:30
You can store these values in arrays

seems like that s the only way.


Thanks marius

##### MariusJuston [Moderator] 08/18/2019 20:09:30
No problems, as far as I know there is way to export these values directly from the plots

##### Huey 08/19/2019 00:34:14
i wondering if there would be a way to store separate sets of values each robot collects, e.g using three identical robot in the simulation

##### MariusJuston [Moderator] 08/19/2019 00:35:21
Well if you store it using arrays, each robot will create a unique instance of the controller so that a controller instance is only associate with the robot

##### Huey 08/19/2019 00:37:49
oh.. you mean like a csv file?

##### MariusJuston [Moderator] 08/19/2019 00:42:12
Sorry I might have been unclear. What I was saying was that each robot when it runs creates its own instance of the Controller. Thus meaning that none of the variables are shared. Each robot, if you were to have a controller that stored the values into an array would have arrays with different values. You could then, if you wanted to, export those arrays to a file such as a *.csv file. Was that what you were asking?

##### Huey 08/19/2019 00:51:01
I'm not sure if I was doing this correctly, I use println function to print values to the console, but then I was confused how to differentiate which value belongs to which robot

##### MariusJuston [Moderator] 08/19/2019 00:51:33
Oh so what you can do is that you can get the name of the robot and then print that along side the value


What language are you using ?

##### Huey 08/19/2019 00:53:40
I'm using java. I created a proto for the robot, they kinda share the same name


Would using DEF work in this situation?

##### MariusJuston [Moderator] 08/19/2019 00:55:10
?


Can you change the ‚Äúname‚Äù field?

##### Huey 08/19/2019 00:57:06
Now that you mentioned it, perhaps I can make the name field public under proto, so I can give each a different name


You think that might work?

##### MariusJuston [Moderator] 08/19/2019 00:57:22
That would be the easiest solution

##### Huey 08/19/2019 00:57:58
Thanks for shedding light on the mate :D I'm gonna try that later :)))

##### MariusJuston [Moderator] 08/19/2019 00:58:05
No problems!


Or if the controllerArgs field is visible you can pass in the name of your robot and then read it using the args in the `public static void main(String[] args) `

Hi, I wonder to know how URDF or solidwork file convert to  Webots PROTO file?

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 08/20/2019 08:15:17
Hi `@owen6789`


We have a script converting an urdf file to a Webots compatible PROTO file, you can find this script here: [https://github.com/omichel/urdf2webots](https://github.com/omichel/urdf2webots)

Let us know if you have any problem with this script


About Solidworks to Webots, you will have to export your Solidworks file to VRML2.0 which can then be imported in Webots (but you will loose some information in the process), here is an example from autodesk (but the process is very similar): [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0FVsFD2rS4&feature=youtu.be](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0FVsFD2rS4&feature=youtu.be)

##### NERanger 08/20/2019 16:14:51
I wonder if there is a difference between the field "coulombFriction" in the node "ContactProperties" and the mu in struct "dSurfaceParameters" in ODE explained as the "coulomb Friction coefficient". I have this question because when I am using ContactProperties, set coulombFriction to 1 is enough to prevent slip, but when I am using collsion handling callback function provided by Webots, I always need to set the "mu" to about 200 to prevent slip (I do not want to set it to infinity since I need to implement "slip ratio"). I suspect that the "mu" explained as "coulomb Friction coefficient" in the document is actually divided by some number like 1000. But I am not sure since the document does not mention it. Can anyone tell me what is the difference between these two things? Thanks for listening to my question üòÉ

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 08/21/2019 06:01:06
`@NERanger`, the behavior you mention is strange, the only difference between `coulombFriction` and `mu` is that `mu` is set to `dInfinity` if `coulombFriction` is -1.

This is done here: [https://github.com/omichel/webots/blob/0e8541fc48cda235cec85f6d3131dcf13c93a3c2/src/webots/engine/WbSimulationCluster.cpp#L228](https://github.com/omichel/webots/blob/0e8541fc48cda235cec85f6d3131dcf13c93a3c2/src/webots/engine/WbSimulationCluster.cpp#L228)



And then assigned to the contact surface here: [https://github.com/omichel/webots/blob/revision/src/webots/engine/WbSimulationCluster.cpp#L279](https://github.com/omichel/webots/blob/revision/src/webots/engine/WbSimulationCluster.cpp#L279)

Are you sure you are setting correctly the flags in your physics plugin? In Webots this is done here: [https://github.com/omichel/webots/blob/revision/src/webots/engine/WbSimulationCluster.cpp#L333](https://github.com/omichel/webots/blob/revision/src/webots/engine/WbSimulationCluster.cpp#L333))

Are you using asymetric friction (more than one value in the `coulombFriction` field)?

##### NERanger 08/21/2019 14:19:34
`@David Mansolino` I am not using asymetric friction. I use mu for the friction between tractor wheel and ground, should I enable rolling firction instead?

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 08/21/2019 14:28:05
Can you try to use in your physics plugins the equivalent than in the Webots contact properties:

```
contact->surface.mu = coulombFriction;
contact->surface.mode = (bounce != 0.0 ? dContactBounce : 0) | dContactApprox1 | dContactSoftCFM | dContactSoftERP;

Hi `@Dannte98`

##### Rambo 08/23/2019 16:12:17
I was applying a force which includes a 'for' loop to a vehicle's wheel in the physics plugin,(in physics step, dbodyaddforce).  the force was supposed to be calculated by integration, I simply use a for loop to add things up. If the division of the integeration is over 3(three times in for loop) and the force was applied, the webots crash. However, if the force is only displayed and calculated in webots, but not applied, the division of the integration could go as high as 1000 and still runs smoothly. And the forces calculated by normal means like adds multiflies and such works normally. I tried many methods, but none worked. I wonder if you guys have any clues to this...üò´

Hi, the light sensor function returns a value 'E' based on the incidence of light on the sensor. How can  i detect a red light using the light sensor function

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 08/26/2019 06:22:55
Hi `@Rambo`: unfortunately, I have no idea about the problem you are experiencing. Did you try to apply a force of 0 on this object? Does it still crash? If so, the pointer to the object may be wrong.


hi `@Heisenberg`: light sensors don't make any different between colored lights. To detect a colored light, I would recommend to use a small white box put in front of a low resolution camera. The box will reflect the color of the light and the camera will get it.

##### Marcey 08/26/2019 08:59:30
Hi, I'm using ROS to get to the translation of my robot. In my program I use the "node\_get\_field"-service. This worked until I tried to convert my Robot to a PROTO. Now I can not get the translation field anymore. The supervisor API says :



    Note: The wb\_supervisor\_node\_get\_field function will return a valid field handler if the field corresponding to the field name is an hidden field.



What would be the correct field name to get the handler to a hidden field?

##### Fabien Rohrer [Moderator] 08/26/2019 09:21:12
Hi Marcey, it seems you are getting a field which is hidden in the PROTO definition.


To verify this, simply look at your PROTO header (open it in a text editor), and check if this field has the "hiddenField" keyword, like here:


[https://github.com/omichel/webots/blob/master/projects/robots/saeon/protos/AltinoWheel.proto#L8](https://github.com/omichel/webots/blob/master/projects/robots/saeon/protos/AltinoWheel.proto#L8)


Is it this case?


To be accessible from the Supervisor, the field should be "open", i.e., defined as a regular field in the PROTO definition.


(like the AltinoWheel.name field mentioned above)

##### Marcey 08/26/2019 09:35:30
`@Fabien Rohrer` thank you! That worked üôÇ

##### Rambo 08/26/2019 14:00:06
`@Olivier Michel` , Thanks for your advice! I tried apply other force(both 0 and larger than 0), and it would not crash. However, if the applied force is calculated by 'for' loops(over 3) in the physics step, webots would crash. I will continue to try to find out the solution. thank you!

##### tonyzjtong 08/26/2019 17:40:44
Does anyone have any idea on why my controller crashes when I'm trying to process the camera image? I think the camera size is too big, I'm using the multisense camera node with 1024 x 544 resolution.


It crashes every time when I'm trying to pass/output the wb\_camera\_get\_image() result. But with a smaller resolution, it's working just fine.

##### Fabien Rohrer [Moderator] 08/26/2019 18:04:59
Could it be due to a memory management issue? Did you check these snippets? [https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/camera#wb\_camera\_get\_image](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/camera#wb_camera_get_image)

##### Frodo 08/26/2019 21:55:52
Hello everybody! I'm new to Webots and I'm developing a bioinspired algorith based on a bug from the family psocoptera. I already have tried it on Matlab but now i want to implement it using e-puck robots. Nevertheless, I'm looking for a way to control them like sending positions or velocities to the robots like goto(). So I don't know if there's already some function that does that or I'll have to implement it by myself. I'm not really interested in a realistic control method since, for now, I just want to get the robots moving with my algorithm. I've already looked at something called Compass and Supervisor but I couldn't manage to find some examples with the e-puck. I'm using Python. Thank you in advance for your advice!

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 08/27/2019 06:02:49
HI `@Frodo`, if you don't car about realistic motion/control, a good solution is to set the 'kinematic' field of the e-puck node to TRUE. Then the Supervisor is indeed the way to go, you can get move/rotate the robot at any position you want.


You can find in this example a simple supervisor controller that moves the position of the light: [https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/samples-devices#supervisor-wbt](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/samples-devices#supervisor-wbt)


The samle python controller also use the supervisor to move a robot: [https://github.com/omichel/webots/blob/revision/projects/languages/python/controllers/driver/driver.py](https://github.com/omichel/webots/blob/revision/projects/languages/python/controllers/driver/driver.py)


The main steps are the following:


1. get the robot node handle: [https://github.com/omichel/webots/blob/7fb253767f2b4077f396f7e6e37510c00cd441a3/projects/languages/python/controllers/driver/driver.py#L33](https://github.com/omichel/webots/blob/7fb253767f2b4077f396f7e6e37510c00cd441a3/projects/languages/python/controllers/driver/driver.py#L33)


2. get the translation field of the node: [https://github.com/omichel/webots/blob/7fb253767f2b4077f396f7e6e37510c00cd441a3/projects/languages/python/controllers/driver/driver.py#L34](https://github.com/omichel/webots/blob/7fb253767f2b4077f396f7e6e37510c00cd441a3/projects/languages/python/controllers/driver/driver.py#L34)


3. in the main loop, get or set the translation field:

Yes, Webots has a GUI


You can model a robot using a tree view by adding nodes defining the physics / graphics / actuators / sensors


It looks like this: [https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/the-user-interface](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/the-user-interface)


The models (robots / objects / environments) are stored in a human-readable format (a language derived from VRML). So it's also possible to modify anything programatically.

##### Fabien Rohrer [Moderator] 08/29/2019 14:06:13
The Webots motion files are CSV human readable files


For example:


[https://github.com/omichel/webots/blob/revision/projects/robots/softbank/nao/motions/Backwards.motion](https://github.com/omichel/webots/blob/revision/projects/robots/softbank/nao/motions/Backwards.motion)


You should try to forge a similar file.


Basically, the header list the motor names, and each line contain a pose (time,posName,motorPositions*)

##### smruti 08/29/2019 14:39:34
actually i m getting my data from kinect and using that data i m getting my joints angle (motor positions)using python . Now i have information of angles of left shoulder pitch and roll, left elbow pitch and roll.Now i want it to be in a file that webots can read.so how should i do that?Continuosly i will be getting data from kinect which will be given to webots .So how should i continuosly convert it to motion files?

##### Fabien Rohrer [Moderator] 08/29/2019 14:42:26
Using the motion mechanism is certainly overkilled. Why not simply and directly actuating the simulated robot motors? (cf. Motor.setPosition(double pos))

##### smruti 08/29/2019 14:43:18
sorry i can't get u

##### Fabien Rohrer [Moderator] 08/29/2019 14:45:51
The Webots motion file mechanism aims to play back a stored motion in simulation. You would like to map the Kinect and the Webots simulated robot in real-time, right? In this case, it seems more appropriated to not use the Webots motion file mechanism, but rather to directly move the simulated robot actuators.

okay thank you

##### ClLebi 08/29/2019 15:21:59
Hi, 

Do you guys have a github where I can find an example of custom ROS controller written in C++ ? I've red in the Guide that it's possible ("It is possible to implement such a ROS node in C++ using the "roscpp" library on Linux and macOS. However, in this case, you need to setup a build configuration to handle both the "catkin\_make" from ROS and the "Makefile" from Webots to have the resulting binary linked both against the Webots "libController" and the "roscpp" library.") and I wonder if there is an example ? Thanks a lot ! I discovered Webots yersterday and I love it !

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 08/29/2019 15:37:42
Hi `@ClLebi`


We are recently doing a lots of progress on this topic. On our main github repo you can find the source of the default ros controller: [https://github.com/omichel/webots/tree/revision/projects/default/controllers/ros](https://github.com/omichel/webots/tree/revision/projects/default/controllers/ros)

This default controller can then be used as a base to create your own C++ ROS controller, here is an example for a car interface for example: [https://github.com/omichel/webots/tree/revision/projects/vehicles/controllers/ros\_automobile](https://github.com/omichel/webots/tree/revision/projects/vehicles/controllers/ros_automobile)

Another possibility is to use the python API, we have a very simple example of this here: [https://github.com/omichel/webots/tree/revision/projects/languages/ros/controllers/ros\_python](https://github.com/omichel/webots/tree/revision/projects/languages/ros/controllers/ros_python)

##### ClLebi 08/29/2019 15:41:29
Thank you ! I tested with the Python but I'm working with LiDAR and it's too slow for me !


I'm gonna look on your links

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 08/29/2019 15:42:25
If you are interested in ROS2, we are currently creating an interface with ROS2, this interface will be much simpler to integrate and to use, here is the repository (this is still work in progress but is starting to be functional): [https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots\_ros2](https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots_ros2)


finnally, you might also be interested by this repo that gather a few example of ROS nodes that use the default ROS controller to communicate with Webots: 

[https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots\_ros](https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots_ros)

This package is released with ros and is documented here: [http://wiki.ros.org/webots\_ros](http://wiki.ros.org/webots_ros)


> Thank you ! I tested with the Python but I'm working with LiDAR and it's too slow for me !



In that case C++ is indeed most probably the way to go. But make sure before that your GPU is powerful enough and your GPU drivers are up to date (this can drastically influence the simulation speed when using lidars).

##### ClLebi 08/29/2019 15:44:48
Yes I'm using it but I'm trying to have a ROS C++ controller for my robot to control topics, datatypes (like using PointCloud2 instead of PointCloud for LiDAR)

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 08/29/2019 15:45:28
Ok then creating your custom ros controller seems indeed the way to go.

##### ClLebi 08/29/2019 15:59:43
Based on the ros\_automobile example I successfully compiled my ros controller ! Thank you David !

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 08/29/2019 16:03:44
Very good news! You're welcome !

##### ClLebi 08/29/2019 17:06:48
Another question, I added the "--synchronize --clock --use-sim-time" args on  controllerArgs but still no /clock published. Is there any line to add in my controller to take this controllerArgs into account ?


(Of course the use\_sim\_time rosparam is set to true)

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 08/30/2019 06:30:25
`@ClLebi`, no you should not need to change anything to your controller. The `launchRos` function will parse the arguments and publish the clock if needed: [https://github.com/omichel/webots/blob/revision/projects/default/controllers/ros/Ros.cpp#L132](https://github.com/omichel/webots/blob/revision/projects/default/controllers/ros/Ros.cpp#L132)

Can you please check if you have the same problem with the default ros controller?

##### ClLebi 08/30/2019 09:05:52
I didn't use launchRos in my controller, I'll test it

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 08/30/2019 10:20:34
`@ClLebi` if you call the ``ROS::run`` function the ``launchRos`` function is called automatically.

##### Frodo 09/02/2019 06:32:51
Do you guys know why I cant change the robot from the example.wbt from the python folder to an e-puck robot. When I do that it just tells me "INFO: slave: Starting controller: python.exe -u "slave.py" 

WARNING: slave: The process crashed some time after starting successfully.

WARNING: 'slave' controller crashed.

##### Fabien Rohrer [Moderator] 09/02/2019 06:33:19
Hi


The controller may have some code relative to the robot, typically the actuator and sensor names.


This may be the reason of the crash.


You should check the actuator and sensor names match with your new robot.

##### Frodo 09/02/2019 06:35:58
Okay Thank you very much, do you know where can I find the names and functions of the e-puck. I dont know why but I'm having a really hard time doing this simulation. I barely can find about the e-puck in webots

##### Fabien Rohrer [Moderator] 09/02/2019 06:37:36
In the user guide, the sensors and actuators of the robots are listed into the 3D component on top of the page:


[https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/epuck](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/epuck)

##### Frodo 09/02/2019 06:41:00
Now I get it, distance sensors from the old robot were "ds" and now they are "ps"


One last question... is there a way to know what the self.Mode.something functions are available for the e-puck?

##### Fabien Rohrer [Moderator] 09/02/2019 06:49:20
Do you speak about the wb\_robot\_get\_mode functions? [https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/robot#wb\_robot\_get\_mode](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/robot#wb_robot_get_mode)

##### Frodo 09/02/2019 06:54:19
Actually I was wondering about these modes
%figure
![unknown.png](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/565154703139405824/617975577684738049/unknown.png)
%end


Because they doesn't appear to be programed in other part of the .py or the driver. But they move the robot for some reason and the code doesn't crash

##### Fabien Rohrer [Moderator] 09/02/2019 07:06:17
ok I see


this mode is simply a variable defining the robot behavior


It's the state of the finite state automaton:

Hi, I am a new user on Webots and I am trying to figure out how can I access the distance sensor data through the supervisor node. I got the position and rotation of the robot but I do not know about the sensors.

##### Fabien Rohrer [Moderator] 09/02/2019 14:54:24
Hi


Programmatically speaking, the Supervisor is a subclass of the Robot class, therefore, what is true in a robot controller is also true in a supervisor controller.


Therefore, you can access the Supervisor devices using the wb\_robot\_get\_device() functions as usual.


cf. [https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/robot#wb\_robot\_get\_device](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/robot#wb_robot_get_device)

##### jhielson 09/02/2019 14:57:08
Nice, I was trying to use some supervisor function instead.  Thanks.

##### Fabien Rohrer [Moderator] 09/02/2019 14:57:51
Note that you cannot get the devices of another robot. The Robot/Supervisor API are bound to get only the devices of the current robot.

##### jhielson 09/02/2019 15:03:50
Hi Fabien Rohrer, when I use this function I get an error. Warning: "ps0" device not found.

[rnnGAsupervisor\_Jh] Error: wb\_distance\_sensor\_enable(): invalid device tag.


It is not recognizing the device.


I am using only one e-puck

##### Fabien Rohrer [Moderator] 09/02/2019 15:06:10
"ps0" is indeed a distance sensor name of the E-puck.proto model. This seems to be correct.


Are you sure you defined well the controller field?


E-puck.controller => your controller

##### jhielson 09/02/2019 15:06:58
On controller node it works but on supervisor node it does not

##### Fabien Rohrer [Moderator] 09/02/2019 15:07:52
you don't need to create a Supervisor node, but you need to enable the supervisor flag on your e-puck node:


E-puck [

  controller "e-puck\_avoid\_obstacles" # This should point your supervisor controller.

  supervisor TRUE

]

##### jhielson 09/02/2019 15:08:46
I have a supervisor node to run my Genetic Algorithm code.


It is seperated from my robot controller

##### Fabien Rohrer [Moderator] 09/02/2019 15:10:33
Ok I see. In this case this will be annoying because you cannot access directly the devices of a robot controller through an external supervisor.


You can think to:


1. Merge your supervisor to your robot controller.


2. Or communicate between the robot controller and the supervisor.

##### jhielson 09/02/2019 15:12:26
I see. I will try to use multiple channels via emitter and receivers.

##### Fabien Rohrer [Moderator] 09/02/2019 15:12:54

Hi all. Quick question. What would be the best way to go about making a robot similar to Yamor? I.e module links with 1 d.o.f rotating connection between them? 

I'm trying to simulate a snake-like robot similar to yamor but with the joint axis being vertical on each module, not horizontal, and having motorised wheels on each module to move it forwards

##### Fabien Rohrer [Moderator] 09/02/2019 15:38:25
Hi Sam


I would recommend you to do our tutorial first to learn how to create simple robots and to be able to move the joints wherever you want:


[https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/tutorials](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/tutorials)


Then to add the Connector at the right position, using the Yamor as an inspiration.


.. and finally / eventually encapsulate your model in a .proto file in order to be able to instanciate it easily.


But basically, you could also try to "hack" the yamor model to change the joint axis and add wheels. Learning this is the focus of the first tutorials.


I hope this helps üòâ

##### SamSmurfitt 09/02/2019 15:46:39
Hi Fabien, I've just finished doing the tutorials this afternoon. Is it possible to get hold of the Yamor files? I've opened up the .wbt file and all it shows is that it is made of multiple modules. I was hoping to find information on how to build one of those modules.


Actually... ignore that I just found the .proto file

##### Fabien Rohrer [Moderator] 09/02/2019 15:48:07
üòÑ


FYI there is also a context menu when right clicking in the scene tree view called "Convert to Base Node(s)". This allows to explode the PROTO into basic nodes

%end


... this is also certainly a good starting point for your project.

##### SamSmurfitt 09/02/2019 15:52:09
brilliant thank you


for making more complex structures am I better off importing CAD models?

##### Fabien Rohrer [Moderator] 09/02/2019 15:53:12
For sure this is for level 3 users üòâ


You should take a look at our Blender addon: [https://github.com/cyberbotics/blender-webots-exporter](https://github.com/cyberbotics/blender-webots-exporter)

##### SamSmurfitt 09/02/2019 15:54:25
is there a solidworks add on, or will I have to convert between the two via blender?

##### Fabien Rohrer [Moderator] 09/02/2019 15:54:33
You can import your CAD model into Blender, modify it a bit, and use this addon to export to Webots.


Unfortunatly we don't have yet any SolidWorks exporter plugin.

##### SamSmurfitt 09/02/2019 15:58:20
ok thanks again.. will probably be a while until I get around to that anyway!

##### SamSmurfitt 09/03/2019 15:04:35
Hi, me again.

In order to get a connector to lock do I have to write it in the controller code, or is there a way to lock two connectors just in the tree?

##### Fabien Rohrer [Moderator] 09/03/2019 15:05:06
Both are possible


depending on the Connector fields, you can achieve these both results.


You should start with the second one (which is simpler to setup and to debug).

##### SamSmurfitt 09/03/2019 15:07:04
I have this set up at the moment, with both connectors touching, and isLocked set to true

%end

##### Fabien Rohrer [Moderator] 09/03/2019 15:08:46
Visually, it seems good.


A very important point with the connectors is that the local z-axis of the 2 connecting Connectors should point each other, as depicted in this image. And y-axis should match at best.


[https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/connector#connector-axis-system](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/connector#connector-axis-system)

Not sure at 100% but it seems your connector is not well aligned (red = x axis towards)

##### SamSmurfitt 09/03/2019 15:12:53
ah that will be it, thanks


I've aligned both the z-axes, and relocked everything but it's still no connecting, is there something else I could be missing?

##### Fabien Rohrer [Moderator] 09/03/2019 15:39:36
You would like to snap first without controller right?


The alignment seems right now

##### SamSmurfitt 09/03/2019 15:41:59
Yeah ideally without using the controller, although I can do if I have to

##### Fabien Rohrer [Moderator] 09/03/2019 15:45:06
Simple set the type to ¬´¬†passive¬†¬ª and autoLock to TRUE should do the job


But to test I recommend you to exagerate the thresholds:


distanceTolerance 0.05

numberOfRotations 0


Better results?


For sure, the direct parent of the connector should have physics and boundingObject defined.

##### SamSmurfitt 09/03/2019 16:58:00

##### Frodo 09/03/2019 18:02:42
Hello! I'm advancing a lot with my algorithm now. But I'm having trouble using the emitter/receiver with python. I've already set different channels for the receivers for every slave. Now I need to send a vector with wheel velocities to every robot [L,R]. I found the documentation but there is no example on how to do this on python.

##### Fabien Rohrer [Moderator] 09/03/2019 18:04:48
Please look at the WEBOTS\_HOME/projects/language/python/worlds/example.wbt


In this example the supervisor sends data to the slave controllers

##### Frodo 09/03/2019 18:07:35
Thank you! I'm actually using that example to understand how it works. In the example they send the same for every robot and they are sending strings as I understand.

##### Fabien Rohrer [Moderator] 09/03/2019 18:08:34
You can send more complex data using the Python struct module as explained here : [https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/emitter?tab=python](https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/emitter?tab=python)


import struct

\#...

message = struct.pack("chd","a",45,120.08)

emitter.send(message)


And to extract:


import struct

\#...

message=receiver.getData()

dataList=struct.unpack("chd",message)

Hi


Webots remote control is too slow. Why? Do you have an idea?


We  previosuly had connected  to robot by remote control in Webots. previosuly, It was fast after we run firmawere instal/update in robotis-op2..

Later we changed our motors and we updated firmwares by using dynamixel 2.alsƒ±o. Now webots remot contr is too slow


WE are using robotis-op2


and visual traking .wbt.


Is the firmware update  a problem?

##### Fabien Rohrer [Moderator] 09/04/2019 06:20:31
`@Frodo` The idea is to use the struct module to pack the data to string:


>>> import struct



\# Emitter side



\# dummy values to test

phiR = 1.0

phiL = 2.1

data = struct.pack('ff', phiR, phiL)  # pack the 2 floats to a byte array.

self.emitter.send()



\# Receiver side

data = struct.unpack('ff', receiver.getData())

print(data)

\# > (1.0, 2.1)

Sorry I went away just now to do some teaching. In rectangle arena, 2018 version has wall tile feature but not 2019. I just wonder if I can get the same. Noted thanks.

##### Fabien Rohrer [Moderator] 09/04/2019 07:23:21
We changed a lot our rendering engine between R2018 and R2019 (we added HDR backgrounds, PBR appearances, and used them intensively) causing few minor modifications in the Assets, like the RectangleArena.


You should take a look at the RectangleArena.floorAppearance field and the RectangleArena.floorTileSize fields.


If you have old simulations, you may fix them.

##### jacqueline 09/04/2019 07:25:10
I see. In my school, we are still using 2018 till recently, I am preparing the update and feedback to the lecturer on the need to edit his teaching materials. May I know if there is more extensive documents to refer to?

##### Fabien Rohrer [Moderator] 09/04/2019 07:28:25

##### Fabien Rohrer [Moderator] 09/04/2019 09:29:20
Hi Owen


The parameter which affects the most this kind of penetration is certainly WorldInfo.basicTimeStep


Ideal value would be 8 (or 4?)

##### Owen 09/04/2019 09:38:01
Awesome, it really work. The overlapping problem is improved a lot. Thanks.

##### Fabien Rohrer [Moderator] 09/04/2019 09:42:22
To go deeper; this value is directly responsible of the physics engine accuracy. the smaller it is, the more physics steps there is per seconds. As our physics engine works with discrete steps, some penetration is required to be able to detect a collision. In any case, a penetration exists in such physics engine. It can only be reduced.

##### ClLebi 09/04/2019 09:45:30
Hi guys, I'm wondering if it's possible to change the world frame to have Z in up direction ? In my point of view it's weird to have Y up, and we make some mistakes using IMU etc ...

##### Fabien Rohrer [Moderator] 09/04/2019 09:46:46
Hi Cleni, this direction is quite arbitrary in fact.


You can setup a world with up along the z axis.


All our assets support to be rotated.


One thing to know is that the the WorldInfo.gravity vector should be changed accordingly.


Several computation (like the main viewpoint movements) are computed thanks to this vector.

##### ClLebi 09/04/2019 09:48:52
Nice ! I didn't know we have only this parameter to change !

##### Fabien Rohrer [Moderator] 09/04/2019 09:49:55
We choose y-axis up because it's in the VRML and X3D specification. So the geometric primitives are working directly (without transformation). Otherwise, we have to rotate all the plans and elevation grids for example.

##### ClLebi 09/04/2019 09:59:10

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 09/04/2019 15:14:44
Not sure exactly where you should put the file, but probably in the same folder than the controller.

You probably want to add the `desktop;` line at the beginning of your controller to use the desktop version of matlab for debugging.

##### Fabien Rohrer [Moderator] 09/04/2019 16:05:31
Hi Clement


Do you need physics on the cube?


i.e. Could a kinematic motion do the job?

##### Clement 09/04/2019 16:08:19
No,  the cube would just be a support for a robotic arm


what do you mean be a kinematic motion ?

##### Fabien Rohrer [Moderator] 09/04/2019 16:09:54
In Webots we usually differentiate kinematics vs physics motions, respecively without running the physics engine and  forcing the position vs using the physics engine to compute the positions.


You may achieve results by removing physics from the solid and by moving the box using a Supervisor.

##### Clement 09/04/2019 16:22:11
ok I understand. And using the physics engine I'll have to represent all the mecanism of the moving part ?

##### Fabien Rohrer [Moderator] 09/04/2019 16:24:56
Yes exactly.


Maybe I have a better solution to propose you:


you could create a robot having an physics arm mounted on a vertical kinematics motorized slider mounted on an horizontal kinematics motorized slider.


then, you can move the 2 sliders in order to match your path, this will move the arm accordingly.


Could this match your expectations?

##### Clement 09/04/2019 16:31:24
you're speaking about SliderJoint ?


or maybe a linearmotor, yes it could do it

##### Fabien Rohrer [Moderator] 09/04/2019 17:37:49
Yes, a slider joint actuated by a linear motor

Here is an example of mechanical loop: [https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/samples-howto#pedal\_racer-wbt](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/samples-howto#pedal_racer-wbt)


Merging solids in Webots can be achieved by copy/paste nodes inside the children list of the parent solid node.

`@David Mansolino` from the GUI.... I want to calculate the error between the target position and the pen position, but the absolute position given by GUI for the pen isn't the same when I use the getPosition function

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 09/06/2019 12:05:40
`@alinux` , you can get the position of any node by selecting it and checking it's position  in the 'Position' tab of the field editor ([https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/the-scene-tree#field-editor](https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/the-scene-tree#field-editor)).

##### alinux 09/06/2019 12:18:27
`@David Mansolino`  but how I get that position by code?

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 09/06/2019 12:20:12
You told me you wanted it from the GUI...

From the code you should either use a GPS node attached to the PEN: [https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/gps](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/gps)

Either use the Supervisor APi which allows you to get the position of any node in the scene: [https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/supervisor#wb\_supervisor\_node\_get\_position](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/supervisor#wb_supervisor_node_get_position)

##### alinux 09/06/2019 12:30:41
I was trying to get with the supervisor, but the position it gives me is not the same as in the GUI

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 09/06/2019 12:32:09
In the GUI you can select in which reference (locally, globally, etc) you want the position. With the supervisor it also depends if you get the translation field or the node absolute position, this can explain the difference if the references are not the same.

##### alinux 09/06/2019 12:44:44
And how can I get the absolute position with the supervisor?

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 09/06/2019 12:48:36
This function will give you the absolute position: [https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/supervisor#wb\_supervisor\_node\_get\_position](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/supervisor#wb_supervisor_node_get_position)

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 09/06/2019 13:30:13
> Where p is a point whose coordinates are given with respect to the local coordinate system of a node



this is only if you want to compute the location of a point for which you know the relative position compared to your node

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 09/06/2019 13:51:34
Ok, let me try


Ok, I checked and I get the same result from the controller and from, the gui, just a few remarks:

  - Make sure to select the 'DEF PEN Pen' node in the three.

  - In the 'Position' tab make sure to select 'Absolute'

  - Your controller doesn't have any loop, so it run one step and then quit (and therfore only print the initial position).


- It can be confusing, but the position returned by the supervisor function is one step late compared to the one of the gui (it make sens because the simulation move one step between your controller step and then when you read the value in the gui).

  - I also see in the world file that you did run the simulation and then saved it. This is not a good practice (which can lead to instabilities), you should try to make sure that when you save your simulation the time is always 0.00.


Let me know if something is not clear or if you think the result still doesn't make sense

`@ShalomShalom` as far as I know no

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 09/09/2019 06:04:10
`@aknuclear` , on which OS are you ?


`@fateme` ,  unfortunately not, but it should be quite easy to modify one of the existing controller to save the sensor value in a file.


`@ShalomShalom` , unfortunately `@MariusJuston` is right, from autodesk Inventor, only the shapes will be exported, you will have to re-specify the joints in Webots, joints are only exported from blender when using our exporter: [https://github.com/cyberbotics/blender-webots-exporter](https://github.com/cyberbotics/blender-webots-exporter)


`@daapa`, yes this is possible, to do that you have to inverse the 'shaftAxis' (e.g. put `0 -1 0`), you will then have to inverse the 'thrustConstant' too otherwise the thrust will be in the wrong direction.


`@Edit`, what you are looking for is the Supervisor API: [https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/supervisor](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/supervisor)


`@Edit`, or you might also be interested by the connector device: [https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/connector](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/connector)


`@aknuclear`, the controller folder is in the project directory close to the world file. You can open the controller in the Webots text editor by right clicking on your robot and selecting 'Edit Controller'. Please find more information about the structure of a Webots project here: [https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/the-standard-file-hierarchy-of-a-project](https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/the-standard-file-hierarchy-of-a-project)

.. in the "General / Python command" preference.


`@HCC` Could you try the safe mode? [https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/starting-webots#safe-mode](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/starting-webots#safe-mode)

##### SamSmurfitt 09/10/2019 13:44:49
Hi again. I have a question about using Matlab as the controller for multiple robots linked together. For my project, I am making a snake-like robot and currently I am modelling it as multiple robots using connectors to link them together. The problem is I have built a mathematical controller, which calculates the motor speeds and angles for the drive and joint motors, for each module, depending on the speeds and angles of the modules in front of it.

%end


So, my questions are; is it possible to have global variables, which each Matlab controller can access? So that one module can access the previous module‚Äôs calculated speeds.

If not, is my only option to build the system as a single robot with lots of children within children etc?

##### Fabien Rohrer [Moderator] 09/10/2019 13:48:19
Hi. Why not defining your global constants in a single file? The controllers may read it.

##### SamSmurfitt 09/10/2019 13:49:57
Oh so if I have a standard .m file in the same directory as the controller's, the controller's should be able to read and write to it?

##### Fabien Rohrer [Moderator] 09/10/2019 13:50:28
yes.


Personnaly, I would go for a file format which is done especially for storing settings. For example JSON: [https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/jsondecode.html](https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/jsondecode.html)

##### Fabien Rohrer [Moderator] 09/10/2019 13:55:03
Good to know too (and a step further), you can use the Robot.controllerArgs to send some specific data to a robot controller. Typically, the path to some JSON config file can be sent this way.

##### Fabien Rohrer [Moderator] 09/11/2019 06:44:04
`@fateme` Hello. Using the e-puck sensors and actuators only, you should use the robot odometry, as explained in chapter 1 here: [https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Cyberbotics%27\_Robot\_Curriculum/Advanced\_Programming\_Exercises#Odometry\_](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Cyberbotics%27_Robot_Curriculum/Advanced_Programming_Exercises#Odometry_)[Advanced]


If you can cheat at some point and get the robot absolute position (by using a GPS or a Supervisor), you can simply move the robot in this direction.


Or maybe, you want to teleport the robot? In this case, you should refer to:

Hi guys, I'm wondering if its possible to deform a mesh during a simulation

##### Fabien Rohrer [Moderator] 09/11/2019 09:36:14
Hi Clement, yes, this is possible. The Supervisor API allows to modify the scene tree in runtime.


this is for example used in this example to draw the trail: [https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/samples-howto#supervisor\_draw\_trail-wbt](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/samples-howto#supervisor_draw_trail-wbt)

##### Clement 09/11/2019 09:41:16
Wow cool! Is it possible to do this from the physics plugin ? The idea is to compute the deformation in the physics plugin through an external library and  modify the mesh accordingly.

##### Fabien Rohrer [Moderator] 09/11/2019 09:42:12
the physics plugin has only access to ODE, not the graphical parts.

##### Clement 09/11/2019 09:45:17
Ok I see. I think I've seen somewhere in the doc that the physics plugin can "speak" with a controller through an emiter/receiver. Is that right ?


The physics plugin API provides the dWebotsSend function to send messages to robot controllers and the dWebotsReceive function to receive messages from robot controllers.

##### Fabien Rohrer [Moderator] 09/11/2019 09:47:42
Yes, exactly.


You physics plugin may transmit instructions to a Supervisor.

##### Fabien Rohrer [Moderator] 09/11/2019 11:48:06
Webots uses libOIS to manage the joysticks. Normally most of the standard joysticks should be compatible with libOIS.


Is wb\_joystick\_is\_connected() returns true? [https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/joystick#wb\_joystick\_is\_connected](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/joystick#wb_joystick_is_connected)


(once enabled)

Hi `@Edit` , yes you can use the Supervisor API ([https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/supervisor](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/supervisor)) to change the structure of your robot during the simulation, however new devices (such motors) requires that you reboot the controller (also feasible with the Supervisor API).

I use "wb\_supervisor\_field\_get\_mf\_vec3f" and "wb\_supervisor\_field\_set\_mf\_vec3f" to modify a shape that is defined  by an IndexFaceSet, with 93 points.


I encounter two mains problem, 1. the simulation is "pretty slow" : Moving 93 points by iteration, the simulation can "only run" at 50% the speed


and secondly, the exact same supervisor coded in C++ runs 10 time slower


How did you get something so smooth ? Also, why do C++ supervisor seems to be so muche slower ?

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 09/13/2019 13:11:44
Hi Gaarci. Changing the vertices at each step is computationnally expensive on the Webots side and it seems 'normal' that you have a slow simulation speed. But this might also depend on the field you are changing, is it a field of a PROTO? About the C++, it is very strange as the C++ API is just a wrapper for the C API, is it possible to share your simulation/controller so that we can check if there is a way to speed this up ?

##### Gaarci 09/13/2019 13:25:57
Thank you a lot for the response !


No, it's not the field of a proto, just a "basic shape" that I generated thanks to Blender (and converted to a world using the blender's plugin on the cyberbotics website)

Ok, thank you a lot for the time you took to respond an help me !

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 09/13/2019 13:34:04
You're welcome


`@Gaarci` , I have made several test and I can explain the difference you get between the C and C++ versions, it is because of the time step, in the C version you define the time step using a #define to be 64. But in the C++ version you use the  world time step (getBasicTimeStep()) which is equal to 8. therefore your C++ controller makes 4 times more steps than the equivalent C version. I have tested to use 64 in both and the simulation speed is very similar.


About optimizing the simulation speed, unfortunately I don't see any simple solution for this, maybe my collegue `@Fabien Rohrer` (who originally did the video you are refeering to) has some idea, but he is out of the office today, I will ask him next week.

Could you help me to solve this problem?

##### Fabien Rohrer [Moderator] 09/15/2019 11:25:44
@Armita yes it's possible. We developed at some point a bunch of predefined motion files (closed loop) for the Nao which can be played using the Webots motion API:


[https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots/tree/revision/projects/robots/softbank/nao/motions](https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots/tree/revision/projects/robots/softbank/nao/motions)

These motions are certainly not matching exactly 0.5 m and 45¬∞ but it's certainly a good starting point to achieve your goal.


`@pavlos27t` This is weird. For sure it's not the expected behavior üòâ We need more information to help you. What is the controller you are trying to build? A sample we release? In which language? C?

`@Fabien Rohrer`  yes sir i went through earlier, edited these motion files and obtained various results,

what i am asking is how can i get the robot perform 3 or more tasks one after other.  means first go straight then take turn then go forward like this.



do we have any c program for it?


Or guide me if there is any other way.

Thank you in advance


And how can i download files from above provided link.?

##### Fabien Rohrer [Moderator] 09/16/2019 06:29:57
You could write a C (or other) controller which plays the motion files one after the other. The Motion API allows to do this.


For example, to play three motion consecutively in loop (I didn't test this snippet):


>>> WbMotionRef motions[3] = {

  wbu\_motion\_new("path/to/Forwards.motion"),

  wbu\_motion\_new("path/to/TurnLeft40.motion"),

  wbu\_motion\_new("path/to/HandWave.motion")

};



int counter = 0;

while (true) {

  counter = (counter + 1) % 3;

  wbu\_motion\_play(motions[counter]);

  do {

    wb\_robot\_step(TIME\_STEP);

  }

  while (! wbu\_motion\_is\_over(motion));

}


These motion files are released in Webots, in the WEBOTS\_HOME / projects/robots/softbank/nao/motions/*.motion path.

##### pavlos27t 09/16/2019 08:21:42

Can you correct the above code sir?


Sir, do we have sit and stand motion file?

i cannot get it in the directory?

##### Fabien Rohrer [Moderator] 09/16/2019 15:22:04
Unfortunately, the sit and stand motions do not exist.


The code seems very correct, you should only copy the motion directory at the correct location on your computer to let it work.

##### marina\_diamanti 09/16/2019 21:36:21
hello, i am trying to do visual mapping using openCV and webots


and some functions (such as cv::findEssentialMat)  require as input focal length and principal point


what value should i add for focal length and principal point?


üôÇ

##### Fabien Rohrer [Moderator] 09/17/2019 06:39:10
`@marina_diamanti` Hi. Webots cameras are implemented in OpenGL, and so have the same constraints. They use a basic parallelepipoid frustum. They can be extended with special effects, including a depth of field "shader".


So the principal point matches directly with the Camera.near field.


The focal length is defined optionally by the Focus.focalLength field (to define the depth of field shader).


(parallelepipoid frustum)
%figure
![frustum.jpg](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/565154703139405824/623409227406376960/frustum.jpg)
%end

##### marina\_diamanti 09/17/2019 08:36:17
so if the near field is 0.05 for example principal point is (0.05,0.05) ?


if i have for exaple  e-puck robot how can i define the focal length then? cause there is no focus field in that case


thanks for answering üôÇ

##### Fabien Rohrer [Moderator] 09/17/2019 12:15:44
The principal point is at the center of the near plane. In 3D, it's (0, 0, -0.05) (5 centimeters in the direction of the camera axis: -z). This value has not much sense in 2D (width/2, height/2 üôÇ ? ).


In the e-puck robot, the Focus node is not defined, so the focal length has not much sense, if I'm not wrong.

How do I do?

##### Fabien Rohrer [Moderator] 09/19/2019 07:26:10
`@daapa` Hi, are you talking about the Fluid.streamVelocity field? [https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/fluid](https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/fluid)

##### daapa 09/19/2019 07:43:33
Yes, it is.

##### Fabien Rohrer [Moderator] 09/19/2019 07:44:26
Ok. You're supposed to use a Supervisor controller. A supervisor can change fields in runtime.


Typically, you could tag your fluid:


DEF MY\_FLUID Fluid {}


and then:


>>> streamVelocityField = supervisor.getFromDef('MY\_FLUID').getField('streamVelocity')

time = supervisor.getTime()

streamVelocityField.setSFVec3f([0.0, 0.0, math.sin(time)])


(In Python üôÇ )

Hi guys ! Has anyone succeed to link new ros msg in controller ? Like nav\_msgs that is not in webots/projects/default/controllers/ros/include


I make it works by copy /opt/ros/kinetic/include/nav\_msgs into webots/projects/default/controllers/ros/include, but if I want to use TF, it's more complicated


What has to be done in the Makefile to link properly ros, tf, etc ?

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 09/19/2019 15:45:25
Hi, you probably want to have a look at this example controller that is extending the default ros controller of Webots: [https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots/tree/revision/projects/vehicles/controllers/ros\_automobile](https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots/tree/revision/projects/vehicles/controllers/ros_automobile)

##### ClLebi 09/19/2019 15:55:43
Yes I've already seen this, the problem is that it links webots-ros, not real ros


And webots-ros is not complete, for example we can't broadcast tf

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 09/19/2019 16:02:20
You're right, one possible solution would be to add the includes and libraries  to your  ros installation in the makefile. It is the `INCLUDE` and `LIBRARIES` variable:

[https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots/blob/revision/projects/vehicles/controllers/ros\_automobile/Makefile#L53](https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots/blob/revision/projects/vehicles/controllers/ros_automobile/Makefile#L53)

> May be because ros boost is different than the version used to create webots deb ...



Yes that's indeed a good explanation.

Recompiling Webots (or at least the ros controller is indeed a good start).


You should try to use only the boost version from your system and not the one of Webots.

You can either remove them from the sources or edit the makefile to remove the '$(WEBOTS\_HOME\_PATH)/projects/default/controllers/ros/include' part


`@LukasBoy2000`,


Welcome! I hope (and I am sure üòâ) you will enjoy using Webots.


I suggest to start with the tutorial: [https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/tutorials](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/tutorials)


And if you have specific question do not hesitate to ask here directly


`@LukasBoy2000`, you might also find some answers in the FAQ: [https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/webots-faq](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/webots-faq)

##### alinux 09/23/2019 02:37:03
Hi! I'm using the irb world and the manipulator is able to go through a table for example. What can I do to prevent the arm from passing through the objects?

##### Stefania Pedrazzi [cyberbotics] 09/23/2019 06:11:36
Hi `@alinux`, usuallly reducing the world time step (defined in `WorldInfo.basicTimeStep`) helps fixing this issue.


If not you could also try to tune the contactProperties (see [https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/contactproperties](https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/contactproperties)).


You should also check that the Robot.selfCollision flag is enabled ([https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/robot](https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/robot)) otherwise, if the table and the arm are part of the same robot, the collision between the two will be ignored.

##### alinux 09/23/2019 11:37:23
`@Stefania Pedrazzi` Can I get some information from selfCollision? I wanna add a penalty on the controller when the robot is colliding with something

##### Stefania Pedrazzi [cyberbotics] 09/23/2019 12:03:12
`@alinux` Did you already check the description of the `selfCollision` flag on the robot documentation: [https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/robot](https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/robot)


this flag defines if collisions between parts of the robot are detected. But it doesn't have any impact on collisions with other objects that are not part of the robot itself.

##### alinux 09/23/2019 12:06:38
Yes, there's a table that is part from the robot


Apparently when it collides with that table, my controller is ignored

##### Stefania Pedrazzi [cyberbotics] 09/23/2019 12:07:39
in that case you need to enable the `selfCollision` flag


you can change the value from the Webots scene tree by selecting the irb Robot.selfCollision item


the `selfCollision` flag doesn't give any information about the collided object. Which information do you need?

##### alinux 09/23/2019 12:25:37
I just wanna get on the controller when there are collisions. There is a way to do that?


I have already enabled the selfCollision flag

##### Stefania Pedrazzi [cyberbotics] 09/23/2019 12:27:33
which function are you using in your controller to get the collisions?


> I just wanna get on the controller when there are collisions. There is a way to do that?

Yes! This is possible


The most generic way to detect collisions is to use a Physics Plugin ([https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/physics-plugin](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/physics-plugin)) and implement the `webots_physics_collide` function ([https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/callback-functions#int-webots\_physics\_collidedgeomid-dgeomid](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/callback-functions#int-webots_physics_collidedgeomid-dgeomid))


Then you can pass data from the physics plugin to your controller using the `dWebotsSend` ([https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/utility-functions#dwebotssend](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/utility-functions#dwebotssend)) function


Alternatively you can add a TouchSensor device to the model and use the TouchSensor API to check for collisions.


But if you want to detect collisions with any part of the robot, then you should add many TouchSensor devices (one per joint Solid)

##### alinux 09/23/2019 12:36:41
I am using a Simulated Annealing controller for find a target and I want to implement a way to avoid the collisions. I will give a look on that Physics collide function and see if it works in my case.

Yes of course, from the view menu you have two option 'Follow Object' and 'Follow Object and Rotate': [https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/the-user-interface#view-menu](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/the-user-interface#view-menu)

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 09/26/2019 15:24:50
No, you just need to select you're robot and then enable the Follow behavior.

Just for info, we did log the issue with the latest version here: [https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots/issues/747](https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots/issues/747)

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 09/26/2019 15:30:14
Yes, you have to put the initial position of the viewpoint where you want it to be (then it is going to keep its position/orientation relatively to the robot constant).


For example if you want to see as if you were the robot you have to put the viewpoint 'inside the robot' at the same position as its 'eyes'

If I am not wrong Cython is for calling C function from Python right ?

##### Raggy 09/27/2019 06:35:35
Cython compiles Python to C


So you can generate those compiled files and directly link those

Yes, that can indeed be a solution in that case, thanks for the pointer

##### Raggy 09/27/2019 06:37:31
Even if there isn't integration with webots, it is probably possible to use Cython to generate C files directly and paste those into webots  `@Cyberninja`


(Although that calls CPython's code too, not sure how webots handles external dependencies)

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 09/27/2019 06:40:37

Evening. Webots is complaining about ikpy not being installed even though I have installed it with pip. I am on macos. Any suggestions why it complains about ikpy not being installed? What Python path does Webots use?


I want to use vscode for my Python developments for webots. Can I add the webots libs to my path in vscode?

##### isayev ND-21 09/30/2019 01:52:41
at some point wasnt there an ERS-210 web bot model back in the day?

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 09/30/2019 06:35:49
`@aysegulucar`, are speaking of the real robot or the simulated one? If you speak about the real one, that's perfectly normal because the API of the real op3 is completely different from the one of the 1 and 2. about simulation, if you can't find the include, you probably have to adapt your makefile (however, since the shape fo the robot is not the same the gait manager may not work for the op3)

##### Fabien Rohrer [Moderator] 09/30/2019 06:37:42
`@SimonDK` Hi, you should basically include WEBOTS\_HOME/include and WEBOTS\_HOME/lib, and link with libController, as explained in this draft page of the documentation: [https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/using-your-ide?version=enhancement-ide-section](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/using-your-ide?version=enhancement-ide-section)

##### Stefania Pedrazzi [cyberbotics] 09/30/2019 06:43:20
`@isayev ND-21` : yes there was a ERS 210 model back in Webots 5. But after Sony decided to drop it, it was no longer possible to fully support it in Webots and only the ERS-7 model was kept.

##### Fabien Rohrer [Moderator] 09/30/2019 06:53:16
`@Daniel Deng` Hi, simulationReset() resets also the controllers, including the supervisor itself! So the termination of the process is the expected behavior.

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 09/30/2019 06:53:42
`@Tutu`, you can listen to a recent podcast about Webots here: [http://www.theconstructsim.com/webots-robot-simulator-ros-olivier-michel/](http://www.theconstructsim.com/webots-robot-simulator-ros-olivier-michel/). Otherwise a simple google search will probably help you find what you need.

##### Daniel Deng 09/30/2019 15:16:32
`@Fabien Rohrer` Thanks for the response! So is there a way to reset only the world from external controller?

##### Fabien Rohrer [Moderator] 09/30/2019 15:34:58
Unfortunately no; Your controller should deal with this. For example by storing its state before reseting it, and restore it.


You could also think about to use another method than supervisor.simulationReset(). For example to reset only the robot position, its physics and its motors.


Another alternative is to use a script which runs Webots as a slave and create one Webots instance per individual training.

##### Daniel Deng 09/30/2019 15:40:15
Ok, thanks for the advice! I will try them and see if anything new pops up.

##### SimonDK 09/30/2019 19:39:21
`@Fabien Rohrer` Hi. I found that page as well, my challenge is that I cannot figure out where to add it in vscode ü§îAny ideas?

##### chamandana 10/01/2019 01:10:59
guys, sorry for interrupting, can you point me to some quick resources to learn Inverse Kinematics. I need to move an end plate vertically upwards, which is connected to the base with two arms.

##### Fabien Rohrer [Moderator] 10/01/2019 06:21:24
`@chamandana` hi, Webots is released with an IK example using an ABB IRB 4600 arm and the ikpy Python module: [https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/irb4600-40#inverse\_kinematics-wbt](https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/irb4600-40#inverse_kinematics-wbt)

##### Owen 10/01/2019 11:21:04
Hi, there are few questions about contact points. When I open the "Show Contact points" function. I obseve that there are only few contact point on a plane(two plane are contact with each other). Is there any way to add more contact points on the plane when simulation running.

##### SimonDK 10/01/2019 11:30:50
When I start Webots it runs the last simulation immediately. Can I turn this off?

##### Fabien Rohrer [Moderator] 10/01/2019 12:05:29
`@Owen` Could you post a screenshot showing your issue here?


`@SimonDK` You can specify the world to open thanks to the webots launcher arguments:


[https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/starting-webots#command-line-arguments](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/starting-webots#command-line-arguments)


(see worldFile)


Typically:


>>> ./webots path/to/you/world.wbt

##### Owen 10/01/2019 12:11:59
The situation is just like this. It looks like there are more than one point contacting black object, but actually there are only one point.

%end

##### Fabien Rohrer [Moderator] 10/01/2019 12:13:17
I see. You can indeed expect to have a contact line there.


Are you sure these objects are defined by 2 Box nodes (cf. Solid.boundingObject) ?

##### Owen 10/01/2019 12:15:15
I'm sure that the two objects are box nodes.

##### Fabien Rohrer [Moderator] 10/01/2019 12:15:29
Ok


Are the black box and the fingers perfectly aligned? As in reality, 2 point collisions are possible in this case if the box is misaligned, and the stifness of the finger joints is really big.


.. and if the contact point has a big friction.

##### Owen 10/01/2019 12:24:26
I think that the black box and finger are misaligned. Is this the main problem to my simulation?

##### Fabien Rohrer [Moderator] 10/01/2019 12:27:44
I think that if you would like to have a better grip, you can act on the 3 parameters mentioned above: 1. box alignment, 2. stifness (due to joint torques or general physics paramaters such as ERP/CFM/basicTimeStep), 3. the contact friction between the finger and the box (ContactFriction). The good action depends on your requirements.


Another clue; I have done some experiments about gripping, and controlling the hand in torque control (rather than in position control) gives better results (you can adjust precisely the used strength)

##### Owen 10/01/2019 12:31:32
Okay, I got it.  I will try. Thanks for your precious and useful advise.

##### Fabien Rohrer [Moderator] 10/01/2019 12:32:41
(this is how the PR2 grabs the boxes in this released simulation: [https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/pr2](https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/pr2) cf. the youtube movie)


You're welcome, good luck with your project.

##### SimonDK 10/01/2019 13:12:47
Thanks `@Fabien Rohrer`. Great, I found it the menu "Preferences > Startup mode". Now it is set to Pause. /cheers


Isn't it possible to undo (ctrl+z) if you delete something from the node tree?

##### JoHn 10/02/2019 15:57:37
Hi guys, could you give me some advices here? I am new to Webots. I would like to run an autonomous driving simulation using ROS and Webots. Now I am able to launch Webots and a truck by following [https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots\_ros](https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots_ros), but I failed to move the truck using services. I am not sure what I am doing wrong. Thanks a lot!

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 10/02/2019 15:59:59
Hi `@JoHn`, you can find all the required services here: [https://cyberbotics.com/doc/automobile/driver-library?tab=ros](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/automobile/driver-library?tab=ros)

In particular these services:

  - /automobile/set\_steering\_angle

  - /automobile/set\_cruising\_speed

If you have any specific question/issue do not hesitate to ask us

##### JoHn 10/02/2019 16:04:27
Hi `@David Mansolino`, thank you for your quick response. This is what I am doing in the ROS node:    steeringClient = n.serviceClient<webots\_ros::set\_float>("vehicle/automobile/set\_steering\_angle");

    throttleClient = n.serviceClient<webots\_ros::set\_float>("vehicle/automobile/set\_throttle");

    steeringSrv.request.value = 0.5;

    throttleSrv.request.value = 0.5;

    steeringClient.call(steeringSrv);

    throttleClient.call(throttleSrv);

    ros::spinOnce();


My question is, do I need to have the services files in the catkin workspace?

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 10/02/2019 16:08:15
If you have installed the webots\_ros package you don't need: [http://wiki.ros.org/webots\_ros](http://wiki.ros.org/webots_ros)

##### JoHn 10/02/2019 16:12:30
Thank you `@David Mansolino`. Yes, I have installed the webots\_ros package.

##### danBOTT 10/02/2019 16:34:40
Hi guys, I'm new to Weebots; can I build a robot completely from scratch without using any built in model? If yes, how can I do that? Thanks.

##### LaCava 10/02/2019 16:36:04
`@danBOTT` Take a look here


[https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/tutorial-6-4-wheels-robot](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/tutorial-6-4-wheels-robot)


The other tutorials go over other scene editing necessities; this here is specifically for the robot part.

##### danBOTT 10/02/2019 16:41:11
Thanks. `@LaCava`

##### JoHn 10/02/2019 16:49:02
Hi guys, when we control robots in ROS, we need to do like this:  timeStepClient = n.serviceClient<webots\_ros::set\_int>(controllerName + "/robot/time\_step");  My question is: when we control vehicles (eg. BMW x5 or truck) in Ros, should we do the same like this:  timeStepClient = n.serviceClient<webots\_ros::set\_int>(controllerName +"/automobile/time\_step"); Thanks  a lot.

##### Saha 10/02/2019 19:06:13
Hey Im new to webots.. Where should I start??

##### JoHn 10/03/2019 01:39:46
Hi guys, is there any tutorials for controlling vehicles using ROS? Now I am able to control robots but not vehicles. I thought controlling robots and vehicles via ROS should be similar, but am not sure why vehicles do not move and steer.


Thank you in advance for any advices.

##### Stefania Pedrazzi [cyberbotics] 10/03/2019 06:31:39
`@Saha` Welcome! I would suggest you to start from our tutorials: [https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/tutorials](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/tutorials)


Hi `@JoHn`, for the `time_step` question: also in vehicle simulation you have to use the same service `<modelName>/robot/time_step`. All the required instructions for the vehicle are then executed internally by the ros\_automobile controller.

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 10/03/2019 06:57:11
`@JoHn`, about your second issue with vehicles and ROS, unfortunately there are no specific tutorial for vehicles with ROS, but as you said there is no real difference (juste a few more services and topics), so this tutorial is valid for vehicles too: [https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/tutorial-8-using-ros](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/tutorial-8-using-ros)

The only main difference is that instead of the 'ros' controller you should use the 'ros\_automobile' one.

##### MaWa 10/03/2019 09:42:42

##### Fabien Rohrer [Moderator] 10/03/2019 09:44:06
Could you tell us what is your traci version?

##### MaWa 10/03/2019 09:45:58
It is the one witch gets installed with the "webots-R2019b\_setup" so it is "sumo-0.30-windows".

From the \_init\_.py file -> @version $Id: \_\_init\_\_.py 23953 2017-04-16 16:19:38Z behrisch $

##### Fabien Rohrer [Moderator] 10/03/2019 10:13:41
Ok, more info...


traci is released in Webots, so there is no versioning. My previous comment has not much sense.


Your issue is weird, we just tested sumo with python 2.7 and 3.7 and it seems to work well.


Do you use a special version of Python 3.7? You should install it as described here: [https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/using-python](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/using-python)


is it a possibility for you to disable the traffic lights? (By passing "--disable-traffic-lights" to the sumo\_supervisor.py controller, thanks to the SumoSupervisor.enableTrafficLights field). This would bypass the problematic code.

##### Saha 10/03/2019 10:23:56
`@Stefania Pedrazzi`  Thanks Ill check that out.

##### Tutu 10/03/2019 11:07:06
`@Olivier Michel` Thanks

##### MaWa 10/03/2019 11:24:20
`@Fabien Rohrer` 

The Python example ->WEBOTS\_HOME/projects/languages/python/worlds/example.wbt works just fine. I can control the 3 robots and there is no crash. So I think Python is working with Webots software.



My version of Python out of cmd.exe -> "python --version" -> Python 3.7.4 (64bit) So the Path is also set correct



If I set the option to --disable-traffic-lights

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 10/03/2019 11:56:50
Hi `@MaWa`, from the output it seems you have another conflicting installation of traci in 'Program files(x86)\Eclipse\Sumo'. This other version is probably not compatible with the one used by Webots. Please make sure that this path is not included neither in your PYTHONPATH and PATH environment variables

##### MaWa 10/03/2019 12:17:11
`@Fabien Rohrer`

`@David Mansolino` Absolutely right! Thanks. Haven't seen it üòÇ üôå

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 10/03/2019 12:19:21
Perfect, thank you for the feedback.

##### JoHn 10/03/2019 14:37:41
Thank you `@David Mansolino` and `@Stefania Pedrazzi` for your kind answers, I appreciate that. Yes, I misunderstood it and used 'ros' instead of 'ros\_automobile' controller. The simulation has worked since last night and I will add more features to the simulation later on, including GPS, lidar and imported map. Thanks again.

##### Himil 10/03/2019 20:30:46
Hey guys, 

We are group of CMU students and planning to use Webots for our capstone project. One of the requirement is a photorealistic images from Webots so that we can use them for SLAM and 3D reconstruction algorithm. While I found a lot of information about Appearance and stuff, I couldn't find much information or samples related to photo realistic images. Can someone guide me to a sample or some tutorial on it ?


Also what sort of maps are importable in Webots ? Can i make a elevationgrid in blender and import it here ?

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 10/04/2019 06:05:59
Hi Himil,

Webots indeed provides highly realistic 3D images for its camera sensors compared to other robot simulators, so that's probably the best choice for your application. Creating environments that generates close to photo-realistic images requires some expertise, but you can start from existing samples and play with the parameters (lights, backgrounds, materials, etc.). A good starting point may be the following environment: [https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/samples-environments#hall-wbt](https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/samples-environments#hall-wbt)


You can import whatever 3D map in Webots given you convert them to VRML97 format. Importing a Blender-generated elevation grid is a typical use case. The Blender to webots exporter may turn our to be useful for such operations: [https://github.com/cyberbotics/blender-webots-exporter](https://github.com/cyberbotics/blender-webots-exporter)

##### Tahir [Moderator] 10/04/2019 08:48:10
Hey Guys

I am using webots to simulate multiple robots. I am using ROS and currently having synchronization problems.

Can someone tell me:

1. How to use wb\_robot\_step when using ROS, as we have no option to use it in the context of controller.

2. How to sync multiple homogeneous robots i.e. every robot should have its own wb\_robot\_step or just one which executes the next physics step would be enough.

Thanks in advance

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 10/04/2019 08:52:04
Hi `@Tahir`


1. if you need synchronization, you should call the `/robot/time_step` service from your node with a non-null argument. It is also strongly adviced to add the `--synchronize` argument in the controllerArgs field of each robot (se more info here: [https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/using-ros?tab=ros#using-the-standard-ros-controller](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/using-ros?tab=ros#using-the-standard-ros-controller)).

2. Each robot should call it's `/robot/time_step` service.


Let me know if once this is done you still have issues

##### Tahir [Moderator] 10/04/2019 09:11:41
sure just let me try


by the way thanks fo r the reply

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 10/04/2019 09:24:04
You're welcome

##### Himil 10/04/2019 15:16:06
`@Olivier Michel` Thanks a lot for the help. Just yesterday I was looking into the blender exporter thing and looks like it might work for us. 

We also want to change the direction of the light as the time in the simulation changes (For example simulating the position of the sun throughout the day and thereby changing the shadow of the objects) Do you think that is something possible ?

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 10/04/2019 15:24:09
Hi `@Himil`, yes of course that is possible, you can change any parameter of the simulation at runtime using a Supervisor controller: [https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/supervisor](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/supervisor)


You can find an example of this where the position of a PointLight is moved here: [https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/samples-devices#supervisor-wbt](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/samples-devices#supervisor-wbt)

##### Himil 10/04/2019 16:16:17
That's awesome. Exactly what I was looking for. I was quickly able to simulate the trajectory I wanted. Example of it

`@Dumindu` yes, best go through the tutorials to learn the basics: [https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/tutorial-1-your-first-simulation-in-webots](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/tutorial-1-your-first-simulation-in-webots)

##### Dumindu 10/06/2019 14:37:07
Thanks `@machinekoder`


I found it hard to learn via tutorials. Is there any resource or slides that explain the basics?

##### machinekoder 10/06/2019 15:09:54
`@Dumindu` I don't know if there are any slides. But I found the documentation very helpful too. Most of the docs contain C examples though. [https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/controller-programming](https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/controller-programming)

##### Stefania Pedrazzi [cyberbotics] 10/07/2019 06:36:52
`@machinekoder` it is correct that the Connector, as all the devices in Webots, can only be inserted as a descendant of a Robot node. This is because in general devices can only be controlled/activated by controller program that has to be associated with a Robot node.

##### Dumindu 10/07/2019 06:50:59
ARNING: "python.exe" was not found.

Webots requires Python version 3.7 or 2.7 (64 bit) from python.org in your current PATH.

To fix the problem, you should:

1. Check the Python command set in the Webots preferences.

2. Check the COMMAND set in the [python] section of the runtime.ini file of your controller program if any.

3. Fix your PATH environment variable to use the required Python 64 bit version (if available).

4. Install the required Python 64 bit version and ensure your PATH environment variable points to it.

##### Stefania Pedrazzi [cyberbotics] 10/07/2019 06:50:59
`@Dumindu` I confirm that there are no official slides about Webots. As already suggested, Webots User Guide and Reference Manual also contain examples. Otherwise it could also be useful to look directly at the code of the sample simulations: for example at `projects/languages/python/worlds/example.wbt`.

It is true that most of the docs contains C examples, but the python API matches almost one to one the C API.

##### machinekoder 10/07/2019 11:26:08
Lets say I want to simulate a touchscreen inside my simulation environment. Would it be possible to get the mouse clicks on a Display device?


Or in general, can I somehow interact with objects in the environment during simulation by clicking on them? Let's say a physical button on a machine control?

##### Stefania Pedrazzi [cyberbotics] 10/07/2019 11:45:51
`@machinekoder` yes it is possible to interact with the environment


you can achieve it using different methods:

1. modeling a button using the TouchSensor device ([https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/touchsensor#bumper-sensors](https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/touchsensor#bumper-sensors) see `projects/samples/devices/worlds/bumper.wbt` for a sample simulation)

2. using the Mouse API and handling the mouse events on the controller (see for example [https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/samples-howto#mouse\_events-wbt](https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/samples-howto#mouse_events-wbt))


In the `bumper.wbt` simulation if you click with the mouse on the black box in front of the robot you will trigger a collision (the same as the robot hits the wall)


`@Dumindu` please note that CMD could find the correct Python version even if the PATH (or Path) environement variable is not correctly set because it uses the Python launcher. Webots doesn't, so you have to really check the Path variable and ensure that the Python installation directory is specified in the PATH.

Hello,

Hi `@jwanner`

##### jwanner 10/07/2019 15:02:52
I am working a modeling a new robot, it is a soft bodied robot with actuators in the body that act like hinges. In webots I want to model it with hinges and solid body part, but for now I only was able to use hinge as so : two body parts linked with a hinge(motor) and when the motor is activated it lifts the linked body part. But I would like that the two body parts to be lift with the same angle around the hinge, is it possible ? ( I am sorry if I am not clear)

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 10/07/2019 15:05:20
You mean the lighter par is lifted more than the weighter? Is this the problem?

##### jwanner 10/07/2019 15:08:25
I have a solid part, a hinge and a second solid part. When I activate the motor of the hinge I would like that both parts are lifted with the same angle around the hinge

like the second line, not the first line

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 10/07/2019 15:14:28
Ok, that should indeed be feasible in Webots.


You should make sure that the total mass of both side of the joint are equal (and probably that the center of mass at an equivalent distance of the joint too).

##### Marcey 10/07/2019 15:15:05
Hello guys, I am using Webots with ROS. I want to get the velocity of a wheel/RotationalMotor, to create a graph where I can compare the set velocity and the actual velocity and see how it changes with different accelerations.



My plan was to use the "/<device\_name>/get\_velocity"-service, but it turns out this just mirrors the inputs from "set\_velocity, right?



Is there an easy way to get the actual velocity(a service would be prefered)?

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 10/07/2019 15:15:51
Hi `@Marcey`, you are completely right about the 'get\_velocity' service.


The workaround is to use the position and to derivate it in order to get the speed


For this you need to use the position-sensors: [https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/positionsensor?tab=ros#wb\_position\_sensor\_enable](https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/positionsensor?tab=ros#wb_position_sensor_enable)

Hello


Is there a way to use the naoqi library with webots ??

##### Sohil 10/08/2019 03:25:43
Hi everyone! I am new the Webots and it looks really promising for my project!

I want to read the time of the simulation and apply a directional light according to it. I know how to set the directional light using the supervisor, but I am finding it hard to read the time or progression of simulation time. Any leads?

##### Tahir [Moderator] 10/08/2019 04:06:45
`@Sohil`  you can get the simulation time in supervisor node.

##### Chirantha 10/08/2019 05:16:27
Hi everyone! I'm actually new to webobts and I'm trying to figure out how to write my script. I prefer using python as I'm more familiar with it (version 3.7, 64-bit). But where can I find the basic Webots libraries to be added into Python needed for this? And also where should I write my code? In a python file or inside Webots itself?

##### Tahir [Moderator] 10/08/2019 05:57:01
`@Chirantha` Hello,

You can write your script both in webots amd external file. In case of Webots(which is preferable), you just need to specify the controller.

In case of an external file you need to specify 'extern' in controller field of the robot.

And about the library I would recommend you to go through webots tutorials. There you will find the necessary information and you'll get an idea how you can proceed in your project may be.


[https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/tutorials](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/tutorials)


[https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/running-extern-robot-controllers](https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/running-extern-robot-controllers)


In tutorials you can find example codes in Pyrhon, C, CPP, Java etc.

##### Stefania Pedrazzi [cyberbotics] 10/08/2019 06:22:02
`@Sohil` the Robot API function `wb_robot_get_time` returns the current simulation time in seconds: [https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/robot#wb\_robot\_get\_time](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/robot#wb_robot_get_time)


`@Muhsin Kompas` the objects falls because the road doesn't have any boundingObject (physics shape). To fix it you have to add a ground object, for example a Floor PROTO

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 10/08/2019 06:29:31
`@hayRobots`, yes even if this is not recommended: [https://github.com/cyberbotics/naoqisim](https://github.com/cyberbotics/naoqisim)

##### Marcey 10/08/2019 08:52:04
I have a follow up question to my question from yesterday. You recommended to use the PositionSensor and derivate it to get the speed. My idea was to record a rosbag of the "/<device\_name>/value"-topic (that worked) and use Matlab to derivate. But I cannot open the bag-File in Matlab and when I want to plot the bag in rqt, I get this error:



For type [webots\_ros/Float64Stamped] stored md5sum [e6c99c37e6f9fe98e071d524cc164e65] has invalid message definition."



Do you have any ideas on how to solve this or for another approach?

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 10/08/2019 09:02:29
It seems the definition of the message (and therefore the md5sum) is different in Matlab üòï why using matlab? It should be quite simple to compute the position difference and divide it by the time difference directly in your ROS controller.

##### Marcey 10/08/2019 09:09:46
the error is not from matlab, but from rqt ([http://wiki.ros.org/rqt](http://wiki.ros.org/rqt)). Yeah, it probably is quite simple, if you know how to do it üòÖ.

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 10/08/2019 09:33:14
You're right it's rqt (which is even more strange), but anyway computing it directly in the ros node is probably the simplest workaround.

From the webots\_ros/Float64Stamped ([http://docs.ros.org/melodic/api/webots\_ros/html/msg/Float64Stamped.html](http://docs.ros.org/melodic/api/webots_ros/html/msg/Float64Stamped.html)) you can get the value (in the data field)  and the associate time (in the header.stamp field) you need then to keep the previous value and time and when you receive a new value you can compute the speed with: speed = (new\_value - old\_value) / (new\_time - old\_time)

##### MIKE 10/08/2019 12:56:52
HiÔºÅDoes the supervisor\_rotation function allow a robot to rotate around a specified axis? Or is it only able to find its own center to rotate?

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 10/08/2019 12:59:39
Hi Mike, If you are speaking about the follow and rotate behavior of the viewpoint, the rotation will be the same as the object itself, the goal is to be able to as if you were the object

##### Sohil 10/08/2019 17:00:09

##### Tahir [Moderator] 10/08/2019 20:22:58
`@Sohil` upto my knowledge,

Supervisor node is available only in Robot. So here in this case you can add a dummy Robot() from which you can enable the Supervisor and than can use this to get the simulation time.

##### jwanner 10/08/2019 20:25:55
Hi again ! Thank you for your help the other day, I was able to achieve what I wanted. But now I have another question, is it possible to have an automatic generation of nodes in Webots ? I have a robot with several rigid segments linked together with hinge/rotational motor, and for example I would like to say, my total length is 10cm and I want 5 segments and it would build the 5 rigid segments of 2cm each linked with rotational motor. I have no idea if it is feasible or if we just have to do it by hand each time, I am curious.

%end

##### Stefania Pedrazzi [cyberbotics] 10/09/2019 06:14:43
`@Sohil` the Supervisor class inherits from Robot class, so you can call the `getTime()` function from the Supervisor instance.


Adding dummy Robot instances as suggested by `@Tahir` should be avoided and it is useless.


`@Muhsin Kompas` the visual issue you get is called z-fighting ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Z-fighting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Z-fighting)).

This happens because the road and the floor are coplanar and can be solved by slightly modifying the translation.y value of one of the two objects.


If you look at the `projects/vehicles/wrolds/city.wbt` simulation distributed within Webots, the translation.y value of the road elements is set to 0.02.


Another option is to remove the graphical appearance of the Floor and keep only the physical one.

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 10/09/2019 06:35:06
`@jwanner`, yes this is feasible, for this you should do a PROTO.

If you are not familiar with PROTO, I strongly recommend to follow this tutorial: [https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/tutorial-7-your-first-proto](https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/tutorial-7-your-first-proto)

Then reading the chapter about PROTO: [https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/proto](https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/proto)

In particular the sub-chapter about procedural PROTO that allows you to use a scripting language inside your PROTO definition: [https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/procedural-proto-nodes](https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/procedural-proto-nodes)

Is there is a way to delay a function. Like delaying a funcition by 1000ms


?

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 10/09/2019 07:35:36
You can simply check the time in the main loop and don't call this function until the waiting time you need is over.

##### Dumindu 10/09/2019 07:35:54

How to invoke a delaying statement there?

  3. get the value


```Python
positionSensor = robot.getPositionSensor('name')
positionSensor.enable(32)
....
positionSensor.getValue()

Hi everyone, i'm new to webots and i'm trying to develop a quadcopter proto, simply with 1 body (solid with shape of a box), 4 propellers and 2 diagonals and i'm reading both from the propeller world file and mavic2pro proto.  however, although the 4 propellers seem to be working fine (with a controller as simple as setting velocity to the motors),  the quadcopter spins around itself whenever the velocities go high and never takes off the ground. What may be the possible issues with this? Thank you all so much.

##### machinekoder 10/10/2019 07:54:30
Can I set the position of a Motor node from a supervisor controller? I was thinking about something along the lines of 

```
motor = robot.getFromDef(name)
position = motor.getField('position')
def set_position(target):
  position.setSFFloat(target)
```

##### Stefania Pedrazzi [cyberbotics] 10/10/2019 08:38:54
`@machinekoder` it is only possible to control a device from its Robot controller and using the device API


so if the Motor node is not part of the Supervisor model, you cannot control it from your supervisor controller


nevertheless you should be able to set the position of the joint, the same as you will do from the scene tree, using the snippet you posted

##### Lars 10/10/2019 13:57:39
`@David Mansolino` Since implementing the `getValue` function to obtain the motor position it just keeps reading `[nan]` at the start of the program or `[0]` after moving the motors into a new position. I didn't have these issues when I initially did the tutorials for distance sensor and neither when I replicated it again.

##### Gautier A. 10/11/2019 07:35:48
Hello, Is there a way to change the geometry of an object using supervisor in a "fast way" ?


I want to simulate deformation on a mesh, I've used supervisor to change the points of an IndexFaceSet, but it's pretty slow.


(Here is the C code [https://pastebin.com/wTBZk88e](https://pastebin.com/wTBZk88e) )


(In another question, do you know how this demonstration/exemple has been done ? [https://youtu.be/OKxdaNqmQco](https://youtu.be/OKxdaNqmQco)  )

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 10/11/2019 09:15:52
`@Lars`: you should enable the sensors so that you don't get the `nan` value any more.


[https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/positionsensor?tab=python#wb\_position\_sensor\_enable](https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/positionsensor?tab=python#wb_position_sensor_enable)

##### Lars 10/11/2019 09:20:22
`@Olivier Michel` I've done that. I also implemented `while robot.step(timeStep) != -1:` to prevent it from reading sensor values before there are anything in there.

Is there anything preventing me from doing this using robot() rather than supervisor()?

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 10/11/2019 09:20:47
`@Gautier A.`: I believe the demo you are mentioning (waves) was achieved about the same way, but instead of changing the coordinates directly, the supervisor changes some field of a procedural PROTO node which in turn will recompute its internal coordinate values accordingly. This might be faster than changing the coordinates directly, not sure.


`@Lars`: you should be able to read this information from any robot, no need for a supervisor. Are you sure your device tags are non-null and the corresponding devices are properly enabled? Do you get any warning in the Webots console?

##### Lars 10/11/2019 09:27:36
`@Olivier Michel` Yeah, the reason I am asking is because I took a simple example from [https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots/issues/711#issuecomment-510832161](https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots/issues/711#issuecomment-510832161) and implemented the getValue() function to read the motion. But I can't do it for my own robot/code where I go through similar steps.


I can upload my own project if that would make it easier.

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 10/11/2019 09:48:23
Are you sure you are calling the step function regularly before checking the sensor value?

##### Lars 10/11/2019 10:19:16
Looks like this

```while robot.step(timeStep) != 1:
    for i in range(len(psName)):
        value = ps[i].getValue()
        psValues.append(value)
    break
print(psValues)
```

Prints all zeros in the list for all of my sensors.

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 10/11/2019 10:50:11
That's normal, it prints the sensor values at step 0, so, it could be that all values are 0. You should put the print inside the loop and should not break the loop.


```
while robot.step(timeStep) != 1:
    for i in range(len(psName)):
        value = ps[i].getValue()
        psValues.append(value)
    print(psValues)
```


Would that work better?

##### Gautier A. 10/11/2019 11:24:07
`@Olivier Michel`  Ok, thank  you !


So basically, If i want to test that out, I have to make a new proto, with the "points" of the coordinate as a field ?


If so, what should be the type of the corresponding field ? "Coord" I guess ?

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 10/11/2019 11:28:43
No, that's not what was done in the demo PROTO.


The field of the new PROTO should be used to recompute the coordinates. It could be for example the amplitude and frequency parameters of the wave and the procedural PROTO will recompute the coordinates according to these input fields.


Do you see what I mean?

##### Lars 10/11/2019 11:30:42
`@Olivier Michel` It just continues to print 0 endlessly. Might there be a problem in the construction of the device(s)?

One of the leg joints with a rotational motor and sensor looks like this:

```DEF LEG-1-COXA HingeJoint {
      jointParameters HingeJointParameters {
        axis 0 0 1
        anchor 0.0716 0.12096 0
      }
      device [
        PositionSensor {
          name "c1_pos"
          resolution 4096
        }
        RotationalMotor {
          name "c1_ser"
          maxVelocity 1
          maxTorque 100
        }
      ]
```

I tried changing parameters such as resolution, but it didn't change the outcome.

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 10/11/2019 11:31:45
Is the motor actually moving?

##### Lars 10/11/2019 11:32:42
`@Olivier Michel` Yeah all motors are moving as they should, that's why I'm so confused.

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 10/11/2019 11:33:56
When you open the robot window, can you see the position sensor values in the graphical user interface?

##### Gautier A. 10/11/2019 11:34:55
`@Olivier Michel`  I think I see. So, for exemple, I can create a new value "coefficient" in my proto, and multiply the points in the field "coordinate" by that coefficient ?

##### Lars 10/11/2019 11:35:51
`@Olivier Michel` Yes, when I run the program and command the first joint to move to 0.1 it changes as it should from 0 to 0.1, but sensor doesn't see the change.

`@Lars`: I mean the robot window. Double-click on the robot and the robot window should open, then you should see a tab with position sensors.


`@Gautier A.`: it should be a procedural proto.


[https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/procedural-proto-nodes](https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/procedural-proto-nodes)


That contains some LUA code which recomputes the coordinates.

`@Olivier Michel` Yeah I see change in the motors, but sensors stay at 0.

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 10/11/2019 12:09:56
Ok, that means the problem is in the sensors, not in the controller.


Not sure...


At which frequency did you enabled the sensors?

##### Lars 10/11/2019 12:11:20
Same as the motors. `timeStep = int(4 * robot.getBasicTimeStep())`

Will anything change if I put the robot into a proto file and use it?

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 10/11/2019 12:13:52
No, it shouldn't change anything.


I would recommend you to start from the provided example:


webots/projects/samples/devices/worlds/position\_sensor.wbt


write a python controller for it and check whether it works.


Then modify it step-by-step to get as close as possible as your own model.


At some point you may find the problem.

##### Lars 10/11/2019 12:17:12
Yeah that was my plan B if my current controller couldn't be salvaged. I have a simulation working that can read position sensor in Python. But it is not for my own robot. 

Anyway thanks so much for the help. üòÄ

##### Gautier A. 10/11/2019 12:28:38
`@Olivier Michel`  Thank you for your response !


Well, your idea kind of works. I'm still stuck at "something" and I don't really know why it doesn't works


I've proceed as you suggested, with lua code, and defined the followings lines :


%{

        print('test')

        local i

        for i = 1,40,1

        do

            print("\n")

            print(fields.points.value[i]["x"])

            fields.points.value[i]["x"] = fields.points.value[i]["x"] + 10

            print("   ")

            print(fields.points.value[i]["x"])

        end

    }%


The problem is that it "display" the change of value in the console, in lua. But it doesn't change the field values in itself, in webots


Where did I made a mistake ?

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 10/11/2019 12:42:01
You should not change input fields, but rather change the coordinates values inside the PROTO.


It's the point list inside the PROTO that should be generated.


Your PROTO should contain an IndedexFaceSet node for which you should compute the coordinates and assign them with the `%{=` statement.

Hi, I would like to know if there is a way to upload a hex file into epuck using Webots.


I did the cross-compilation from Webots to generate the file but I do not know how to upload on E-puck robot. It is already paired via Bluetooth.

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 10/11/2019 13:55:59
You can do this from the Robot Window choosing Upload HEX pop-up menu: [https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/epuck#robot-window](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/epuck#robot-window)

##### jhielson 10/11/2019 13:59:33
In my computer, it opens a generic robot windows. There are some information about the readings of the sensors but I can not find this option. Am I doing something wrong?

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 10/11/2019 14:00:41
That means the robot is not recognized as an e-puck robot... Did you change it?


Can you open the default e-puck world? In this one, you should be able to open the e-puck robot window and upload your HEX file.

##### jhielson 10/11/2019 14:02:36
I didnt generate the project. I am gonna check the default one. Thanks Oliver Michel!!!


You are right. It works on the default epuck project.

##### ClLebi 10/11/2019 17:47:22
Hi Guys, I'm wondering if it's possible to have a Collision sensor without generating a collision. Like a box sensor that say : There is something in me without using radar or lidar or camera etc. Juste a Collision sensor without generating collision ?

##### JoHn 10/11/2019 19:49:06
Hey guys, I'd like to control multiple robots via ROS in one environment. Should each robot have one ROS node to control it? Thanks a lot.

##### SimonDK 10/11/2019 20:14:02
Can I select multiple objects in the Scene Tree sidebar? I need to select several hundred items

##### Lars 10/12/2019 12:47:19
`@Olivier Michel` Since yesterday I worked on some changes for the position sensor that did not resolve my issue. Then it occurred to me that it was perhaps not the controller or my code that was at fault, but rather something with the device(s). Then I stripped everything away to see what might be the problem. And apparently it was because I had put a value in the resolution field, when I changed it to -1 (default value) I was able to read the position of all my sensors.

But this begs the question as to why I was unable to specify the resolution in the first place? According to the documentation in [https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/positionsensor](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/positionsensor) you can set the resolution to anything in the interval of 0 and infinity(-1). So what's the problem here?

##### SimonDK 10/12/2019 18:14:11
Can I mirror a component?

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 10/14/2019 06:09:23
`@ClLebi`: yes, this is possible, you will have to program it from a physics plugin, detect the collision, then remove it, so that it won't be taken into account by the physics engine.


`@JoHn`: what you want to do is possible. I see no problem doing that. Did you try to do it? Did you experienced any problem?


`@SimonDK`: it's not possible to select multiple objects in the scene tree. Not sure what you mean by mirroring a component... It is indeed possible to set a negative Transform.scale parameter to somewhat mirror a shape. Is that what you meant?


`@Lars`: it's great that you found the problem. We are going to investigate this resolution problem to see whether you uncovered a bug... I will be back about it.

Hi all!

Hi  `@Choomah` !

##### Choomah 10/14/2019 07:49:34
I am trying to build an MVP for an idea, which incorporates [https://robotbenchmark.net/](https://robotbenchmark.net/) style of using webots. Looking at [https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/web-simulation](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/web-simulation) and following that, I end up not seeing a web interface.


is there another version or should you build your own ?

##### Stefania Pedrazzi [cyberbotics] 10/14/2019 07:52:42
The web interface is available in the webots.min.js package available on the cyberbotics website ([https://cyberbotics.com/files/repository/www/wwi/R2019b/webots.min.js](https://cyberbotics.com/files/repository/www/wwi/R2019b/webots.min.js))


You have to build a web page that instatiates the webots.View main objects defined in `webots.min.js` adn executes it .

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 10/14/2019 13:09:42
Sure, you can define whatever rotation axis you need.


This page can help you to define the rotation axis in VRML format: [https://cyberbotics.com/rotation\_tool](https://cyberbotics.com/rotation_tool)

I want let a cylinder supervisor rotation with a axis parallel to y axis and do not use hingejoint node,  how can I set supervisor rotation parameters?


If the Supervisor robot rotates around a defined axis parallel to the Y-axis and does not apply the differential drive method, how should the rotation parameters of the Supervisor node be set?


`@Olivier Michel`  The axis does not pass through the origin of the robot


Because the hingejoint node need a lot of sources of computer, however, we want simulate with about 49 robots. So we need simplify the robot's model.

##### Stefania Pedrazzi [cyberbotics] 10/14/2019 14:18:04
`@Choomah` the error about `The console states: WebSocket error: Unknown message received: "x3d;broadcast"` is probably because the Webots version and the `webots.min.js` version are not matching

##### Willem3141 10/14/2019 14:56:20
`@David Mansolino` Unfortunately I can't get Webots to compile on Linux with the inspector code enabled, because `<QtWebKitWidgets/QWebInspector>` cannot be found (my understanding is that Webots uses `QtWebEngine` instead of `QtWebKit` on Linux). I then found out that you can set `QTWEBENGINE_REMOTE_DEBUGGING` to some port number, and open `http://localhost:<port>` in Chrome to do remote debugging. Unfortunately this doesn't work either: after choosing the page to inspect, it only results in a blank page üò¶


Anyone has any experience with `QTWEBENGINE_REMOTE_DEBUGGING`?

##### JoHn 10/14/2019 14:56:55
Hey guys, now I am able to control one vehicle via a ROS node. My question is, is it possible to control multiple vehicles via ROS at the same time? Should each vehicle have one ROS node to control it? Thank you very much for your help.

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 10/14/2019 14:58:00
`@JoHn`, as you prefeer you can either control on vehicle by node either control several vehicles from the same node (in that case you have to call the corresponding services for each vehicles)


`@Willem3141` oh yes you are completely right `QtWebKitWidgets` is valid on windows only


about `QTWEBENGINE_REMOTE_DEBUGGING` you should actually be able to start Webots with the `--remote-debugging-port=....` port. See this link for more information: [https://doc.qt.io/qt-5/qtwebengine-debugging.html](https://doc.qt.io/qt-5/qtwebengine-debugging.html)

##### JoHn 10/14/2019 15:05:52
Thank you `@David Mansolino` for your answer. I tried to control two vehicles in a single ROS node. However, sometimes only one vehicle moved or both vehicles did not move. I am not sure what mistake I made. I am guessing the problem may come from the 'controllername'. Would you give me some advice?

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 10/14/2019 15:08:21
You probably want to add the `--name=<robot_unique_name>.` argument to both controller with different unique\_names to have always the exact same services/topics names: [https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/using-ros#using-the-standard-ros-controller](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/using-ros#using-the-standard-ros-controller)

üòÄ thanks

##### Willem3141 10/14/2019 15:10:25
`--remote-debugging-port=...` behaves the same as setting `QTWEBENGINE_REMOTE_DEBUGGING`, that is: you get a list with inspectable pages (in my case: the robot window and a user guide viewer), but clicking on either of these just results in a blank window. Webots returns an empty HTTP response üòï

Thank you `@David Mansolino`. Is this a correct way to add the argument?

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 10/14/2019 15:32:18
yes, but you have to replace `<robot_unique_name>` by something else (a name that you choose and that is different for each vehicle)

##### Stefania Pedrazzi [cyberbotics] 10/14/2019 15:36:53
`@Choomah` yes, the "Edit controller" option in the robot context menu of the web interface should be enabled if the "controller" field is visible in the Webots scene tree

##### Stefania Pedrazzi [cyberbotics] 10/14/2019 15:40:19
You should set `view.broadcast = false;` or simply do not set it (for the webots.View instance).

##### Choomah 10/14/2019 15:43:05
nice!


is there a way for me to start the code editor immidiatly after the scene is loaded in a predefined div ?

##### Stefania Pedrazzi [cyberbotics] 10/14/2019 15:44:36
> is there a way for me to start the code editor immidiatly after the scene is loaded in a predefined div ?

no. you have to modify `webots.min.js` to do this

##### Choomah 10/14/2019 15:45:41
that would the webots.js and than run make right ?

##### Stefania Pedrazzi [cyberbotics] 10/14/2019 15:45:41
probably unsetting the broadcast value is not enough

##### Choomah 10/14/2019 15:46:03
It was


it is working now

##### Stefania Pedrazzi [cyberbotics] 10/14/2019 15:46:13
ok, nice

##### Choomah 10/14/2019 15:46:23

Simulation does NOT run yet

##### Stefania Pedrazzi [cyberbotics] 10/14/2019 15:47:27
> that would the webots.js and than run make right ?

yes, the make  bundles the dependencies and minimize the JS file. Then you have to make sure to link to your own webots.min.js file

##### Choomah 10/14/2019 16:08:57

`@Stefania Pedrazzi` Thanks for the help man!


If anybody can point me in the right direction


I still encounter two problems: 1. can't load the textures. It times out. 2. simulation doesn't run

##### Mehran Raisi 10/14/2019 20:29:28
Hi everyone, I'm using pr2 robot in my project and I want to derive its Denavit Hartenberg parameters from webots. I know in robots proto, there exists its coordinates but its really hard to work with. If anyone has its parameters, I would appreciate to share these data. thanks.

##### Stefania Pedrazzi [cyberbotics] 10/15/2019 06:15:42
`@Choomah` 

1. did you try to connect directly to the textures URL? does it work?

2. what happens exactly when you click on the play button? and the step button?

I would suggest you to clear the browser cache, this helps sometimes


`@Mehran Raisi` about the PR2 Webots model: instead of using the data from the PROTO file you could

1. convert it to base nodes: right click on the PR2 item in the scene tree and "Convert to base node(s)"

2. if you select a Solid or device node, then you can get the absolute or relative position of the part in the "Position" tab of the field editor (just below the scene tree)

##### Choomah 10/15/2019 06:32:13
`@Stefania Pedrazzi` 1. I get an Empty response if I visit the root. I get an 404 when I visit the texture file

##### Stefania Pedrazzi [cyberbotics] 10/15/2019 06:32:48
The texture file should be automatically published by Webots

which version are you using? always the revision one?

##### Choomah 10/15/2019 06:34:27
always the revision one with you hotfix patch applied

%end

##### Stefania Pedrazzi [cyberbotics] 10/15/2019 06:43:58
Did you clear the cache?

to debug this you should inspect what does the Webots instance. First step would be to simply start webots with the `--stream` option and try to connect to the texture (with default port at http://localhost:1234/textures/<texture path>)

##### Choomah 10/15/2019 06:48:37
cache is cleared I will restart the computer just to be sure


/root/webots/webots --batch --mode=pause --minimize --no-sandbox --stdout --stderr --stream=port=2001;monitorActivity;controllerEdit /root/webots/projects/samples/robotbenchmark/robot\_programming/worlds/robot\_programming.wbt


Gives empty response on localhost:2001


brb

##### Stefania Pedrazzi [cyberbotics] 10/15/2019 06:55:32
on localhost:2001 it is normal that doesn't find anything, but for example this URL should work http://localhost:2001/textures/conveyor\_belt\_rubber.jpg


if it doesn't then you should inspect if Webots prints any error message (in the Webots console or in the terminal)


I just tested on revision and it works just fine on my machine

##### Choomah 10/15/2019 07:13:18
so you ran the same command and you can access the texture files?


hmmm...

##### Stefania Pedrazzi [cyberbotics] 10/15/2019 07:14:29
yes

##### Choomah 10/15/2019 07:17:54
does the streaming server write any logs ?


no logs in /var/log

##### Stefania Pedrazzi [cyberbotics] 10/15/2019 07:19:25
the streaming server writes logs by default in the <webots>/resources/web/server/log folder. But here the problem seem to come from Webots itself


Webots writes errors to the stderr/stdout and in the Webots console


one thing you could also try is to test a different port

##### Choomah 10/15/2019 07:24:47
Tried different port. same result


It's a shame we couldn't get it to work


I'll try later again

Hi `@David Mansolino`, I am controlling two trucks by using one ROS node. As you suggested yesterday, I put "--name=leader" and "--name=aaa" in the 'controllerArgs' of each truck. Then in the ROS node, I wrote the code as shown in the picture. But it did not work, the simulation time just freezed. Could you please give me some advice?

I need to call timeStepClient for both vehicles, is that right?

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 10/15/2019 14:33:40
Yes exactly once per vehicle


with a positive integer value for the 'value' argument.

Is the setting for the truck wrong?

is it because there is a steering limit (from -0.4 to 0.4)?

> Thank you very much.



Very good news.

Yes exactly, the steering angle is probably limited to -0.4 to +0.4 in the vehicle model you are using. Which model are you using?

##### JoHn 10/15/2019 17:19:01

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 10/16/2019 05:51:14
`@JoHn`, I just checked and for the Truck model it is indeed limited to -0.4 to + 0.4, if needed you can change this here: [https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots/blob/revision/projects/vehicles/protos/generic/Truck.proto#L36](https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots/blob/revision/projects/vehicles/protos/generic/Truck.proto#L36)

Hi, I am trying to improve the speed of my simulation in order to reduce the training time of my model.  I saw that I can increase the WorldInfo.basicTimeStep value but can it be greater than my current wb\_robot\_step. For example, my wb\_robot\_step value is 256 and I would like to use 2048 as my basicTimeStep.

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 10/18/2019 15:33:45
Hi `@jhielson`, unfortunately no, the WorldInfo.basicTimeStep shouldn't bee bigger than your controller tiem step.


Note also that 256 is already a quite big value, usign higher values may make your simulation unstable/unprecise.


But there are probably other solution to make your simulation faster, have you read this page: [https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/speed-performance](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/speed-performance) ?

##### dulla 10/20/2019 23:47:23
Hello, i have just come across this website as i was looking for website that are about making a robot design


is this what the website is about?


like it shows which parts you need to assemble the robot


?

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 10/21/2019 06:59:09
`@Marcey`: The appearance of objects (color, reflections, etc.) has no impact on the Lidar measurements. The Lidar only uses depth of field to compute its return values (based on the OpenGL depth buffer, also called Z buffer), in addition to the optional noise value.


`@dulla`: Yes, Webots is a useful tool to design your own robot in simulation, program it and see how it will interact with its environment.

no one in webots and another in matlab app

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 10/23/2019 07:39:06
Ok, then why aren't you using directly a Matlab controller?

##### fateme 10/23/2019 07:39:47
because i use toolbox of matlab

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 10/23/2019 07:40:51
Ok, in that case you may need other way to communicate between Webots and Matlab than files (which are indeed quite slow). Have you tried using TCPIP for example? Or pipes?

##### fateme 10/23/2019 07:41:14
no

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 10/23/2019 07:42:56
In that case that's probably the way to go for better performances.

##### fateme 10/23/2019 07:44:12
if i want use another way except file what way you suggest?


the amount of time\_step in wb\_robot\_step(time\_step) is effective in run time?

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 10/23/2019 07:45:59
If you are in real\_time mode then Webots will try to match as much as possible the amount time\_step to the real time.


> if i want use another way except file what way you suggest?



I am not an expert in Matlab, but you should check what is the simplest to implemetn in Matlab between pipes and TCPIP communication.

Perfect! thank you for the feedback üôÇ

##### Gautier A. 10/28/2019 13:26:01
So, I modified as you said. But there's still a thing I can't understand. The robot to behaves likes the "puma arm" was very heavy, when I explicitely defined all the masses as 0.1kg (and the mass of the pioneer of something like 50kg). It's especially wired when it seems that the change of direction of the Puma seems to impact the inertia force of the "whole robot" (which is good and excepted !)

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 10/28/2019 13:29:02
What you are changing there, is the center mass of the base segment of the robot, but all the children segment still have their center of mass up.

##### Gautier A. 10/28/2019 13:30:14
Yes, I agree. But because I set a masse of the pionner 500x time superior than the masses of the Puma, the Puma should have a negligible impact, shouldn't it ?


Or did a make a mistake somewhere else ?

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 10/28/2019 13:31:04
Let me check quiclky your simulation files


I don't understand qhy you have 3 robots in your hierarchy.


the pioneer should be the rrot robot and the puma a direct children of the pioneer.


Additionnally, the total mass of the pioneer is 42.3kg and of the puma 27.4, therefore the difference is not so big

##### Gautier A. 10/28/2019 13:41:56
Thank you !


For the problem of the three robots, well, it's because I want to see how it would behaves if two "concurrent robot" with each one having its own controller would behave. It's for a project of a simulator, where mesh would be simulated as robot to simulate very little deformation of their mesh (and IndexFaceSet) for exemple


How can you check the total weight of a robot ? I was pretty sure I changed the mass on all the field of the Puma

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 10/28/2019 13:46:20
If you select any Robot/Solid node in the scene-tree you can then go to the node editor in the 'mass' field ans select 'including descendants', it will then compute the total mass of the robot/solid with all of its descendants:

##### threeal 10/28/2019 17:30:24
when a world has 2 robots, does it treats each robot as separate node when using ros controllers?

##### Tahir [Moderator] 10/28/2019 17:34:35
`@threeal` Yes, different robots are treated sepreately, They will have all the information in different ros services (namespaced by the robots name you specify)

##### threeal 10/28/2019 19:55:27
and how do i know if i subsribe a message from one robot and not the other?


and in the e-puck sample, i tried to change the robot name, it changes the topic name of the robot, but the rosnode that control the robot could still able to send a message to webots simulator even if it has different topic name. how could it happens?

##### Tahir [Moderator] 10/28/2019 20:10:04
`@threeal`  when you change the robot name and add corresponding arguments in the controller args field then every information changes from rosnodes, topics and list.


By changing the robot name the all ros names are appended by robot name

You can check here in the world file protos are the same with different naming arguments so everything changes accordingly


you can check it with rosnode list, rosservice list etc.


and connection of nodes you can check by rqt\_graph

##### Gordon 10/29/2019 06:55:01
`@David Mansolino` I have got errors which is with Rviz crashing the when it try to read Pointcloud topic which was created from Webot\_ros. It seems to be with "ros Assertion `(min.x <= max.x && min.y <= max.y && min.z <= max.z) && "The minimum corner of the box must be less than or equal to maximum corner"' failed."

I suspect this is due to some erroneous point cloud, I can see 11MB/s of point clouds are created at 32 Hz. but some or all may have some errorneous points which crashes Rviz.

Is there any method to validate or fix point cloud from webots side?


Is there any method publishing sensor\_msgs::PointCloud2? instead of PointCloud?

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 10/29/2019 07:25:23
`@Gordon`, unfortunately, only `sensor_msgs::LaserScan` and `sensor_msgs::PointCloud` are supported yet. However, you should be able to change/extend this quite easily. The publication fo the `sensor_msgs::PointCloud` is done here: [https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots/blob/revision/projects/default/controllers/ros/RosLidar.cpp#L121](https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots/blob/revision/projects/default/controllers/ros/RosLidar.cpp#L121)

In this function you should be able to extend to `sensor_msgs::PointCloud2` and then you have to recompile the `ros` controller (let me know if you have any issue doing so).

##### Gautier A. 10/29/2019 08:44:09
Concerning the implicit solid merging indicated on that page ([https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/physics](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/physics)), does that mean that the upper (most high parent in the node hiearchy) retains all the information of mass and bounding box of all its children solid ?


(Do you have any more reference on how the physics engine works and merge the bounding box / the masse of the differents solid ?)

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 10/29/2019 08:49:30
> does that mean that the upper (most high parent in the node hiearchy) retains all the information of mass and bounding box of all its children solid ?



No each solid should have it's own mass and boundign box informations, then they masses and bounding boxes are just merged together.

##### Gautier A. 10/29/2019 08:54:14
But, what I mean is that the "upper parent" parents is going to have its own boundingbox/masses, which will be the sum of the information in its own physics node, and its children physics node ?

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 10/29/2019 08:55:25
Yes exactly.

##### Gautier A. 10/29/2019 08:55:43

Hi everyone, 

I have a question about the physics node. For example, if we design a robot with multiple hinge joints and hence multiple endsolids with defined physics node(weights and center of mass), does the robot's physics node have to  include all the weights of all its parts?

Thanks in advance

##### Fabien Rohrer [Moderator] 10/29/2019 09:25:50
hi


No, the physics node of the robot should only take into account the mass of its associated bounding object.


The Robot node derives the Solid node.


You can monitor the overall mass (the sum of all the solids) by selecting the robot, and check the mass tab under the scene tree.

##### Oxygenious 10/29/2019 09:29:51

##### threeal 10/29/2019 10:45:24
i am sorry, but when i want to create a robot program using ros, should i create the behavior in webots controller or in the ros node?


and how is the relation between both of them?

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 10/29/2019 10:48:23
The ros controller is just the interface between ros and Webots, you should create the behavior in the ros node.


You can find some example here: [http://wiki.ros.org/webots\_ros/Tutorials/Sample%20Simulations](http://wiki.ros.org/webots_ros/Tutorials/Sample%20Simulations)

##### Fabien Rohrer [Moderator] 10/29/2019 16:17:02
Hi. Normally, this should work. Do you use the Joystick API directly?


[https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/joystick#wb\_joystick\_get\_axis\_value](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/joystick#wb_joystick_get_axis_value)


wb\_joystick\_get\_axis\_value should be able to return the "red pad" axis. The point is to find to which axis id it's mapped. (the argument of wb\_joystick\_get\_axis\_value() )

##### JoHn 10/29/2019 16:24:27

When I subscribe this topic, I delete <> and replace X with 0 or 1. Is this a correct way?

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 10/29/2019 16:27:27
Yes exactly, can you print the number of axes detected by webots by calling the '/joystick/get\_number\_of\_axes' service just to check?

`rosservice call .../joystick/get_number_of_axes`

##### JoHn 10/29/2019 16:28:42
Hi `@David Mansolino`, thank you for your response, Yes, I am double-checking it. üòÅ


Hi `@David Mansolino`, my joystick has 6 axis. Does it mean that each stick on the joystick has 2 axis? And are the axis numbering from 0 to 5? For example, if I only use one stick (marked in the red circle) on the left side of the joystick to control both steering and speed (throttle and brake), I should subscribe the topics of /joystick/axis0 and /joystick/axis1, is this correct? Thank you in advance.

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 10/29/2019 17:07:36
> Does it mean that each stick on the joystick has 2 axis?



Yes, that's often the case with such kind of joystick.



> And are the axis numbering from 0 to 5?



Yes.



> I should subscribe the topics of /joystick/axis0 and /joystick/axis1, is this correct



I can't say which axis is which one, you probably want to print the value of all the 6 axes and then move them one by one to identify which one is which one.

Hi Gautier

##### Gautier A. 10/30/2019 08:10:32
I was thinking about doing some variation of the motor using the source of webots, but I'm not sure if that approach is wise


Hi Fabien !

##### Fabien Rohrer [Moderator] 10/30/2019 08:11:55
I could first confirm that it's certainly possible to model a reaction wheel in Webots, indeed, the physics engine supports momentum reactions.


That said, we don't have examples of such setup.


I expect that controlling a (or several) rotational motor(s) in torque control is a good starting point.


You could have the actual speed of the motor thanks to a PositionSensor (you should just derive the position along the time once to get the speed).


So I confirm Webots allows to set the input and retrieve the output of the algorithm you mention.


but the algorithm should be written by yourself.


Is it a satisfying answer?

##### Gautier A. 10/30/2019 08:16:02
Yes, thank you a lot !


I've already tried some little experiments with rotationnal motors and position sensor (using hinge joint)  and it seemed to be working, but to be honest, what worries me a little is the  abscence of anti-windup in this configuration (because the torque "saturate" at 5mNm, the PID is gonna integrate the error caused by the saturation)

##### Fabien Rohrer [Moderator] 10/30/2019 08:24:23
Indeed, the PID control we provide does not propose an anti-windup. But in theory, this could be implemented in the controller. I'm wondering why you get this saturation? Did you play with the maxTorque field? Normally this field should allow you to increase the motor torque.

##### Gautier A. 10/30/2019 08:35:58
It's more because of the caracteristic of the wheel itself. The torque is very low in the "datasheet" of the constructor


It's a reaction wheel used on satellite, it doesn't neccesitate a lot of torque.

##### Fabien Rohrer [Moderator] 10/30/2019 08:36:40
Ok I see, this sounds good then.


Are you interested on modeling a satellite in Webots? This is definitively something I would like to see üôÇ

##### Fabien Rohrer [Moderator] 10/30/2019 12:23:01
`@Oxygenious` Hi, let me give a look..


Ok, I have your simulation running on my computer.


It seems you defined well the contact properties between "sol" and "caoutchou"


there is a typo in ContactProperties


"caoutchou" => "caoutchouc" üòÅ


Once fixing this, the friction acts as expected.


By the way, you have also several not-related warnings about density. You can fix them by changing these fields: Physics.density=-1 for each Physics node where you defined the Physics.mass

##### Oxygenious 10/30/2019 12:46:52
when we fix the mass , shouldn't the density be ignored?

##### Fabien Rohrer [Moderator] 10/30/2019 12:47:41
Yes, it's the case. My comment is just about how to remove the annoying warnings appearing in the Webots console (I looked at them first).

##### Oxygenious 10/30/2019 12:49:57
Ah okay, so i fixed the typo but the robot still cannot climb the stairs.


I suppose that there is a problem between "bois" and "caoutchouc", they are not always in contact like it would be in real life.

##### Fabien Rohrer [Moderator] 10/30/2019 12:54:43
the motors are not powerful enough to climb the stairs.


you could either increase the friction (I set the ContactProperties.coulmbFriction to 10 between caoutchouc and sol, and it is working)


or to increase the Motor.maxTorque (I didn't test this)


=> you're right about the bois <=> caoutchouc, it's set to -1. this is not a good idea üôÇ


setting both coulombFriction to 10 gives this result

##### Fabien Rohrer [Moderator] 10/30/2019 13:22:49
This kind of issues is due the robot layout. I would bet that the same occurs on a real robot üòÑ


The point is about to find good physics properties to let this work smoothly.


For example, if the spring/damping are too low the robot cannot climp the box, if they are too big, they cannot retract quickly enough (as shown here).


I'm pretty sure a good tradeoff can be found, because this layout is used in real robots.

> I am just guessing, would the two GPS be conflict with each other?



They should not. Maybe you can use the robot-window to see in real time the value of the GPS (just double click on your truck to open it).

Yes, the 'accuracy' is 0.

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 10/31/2019 14:58:47
ok, and does the values displayed in the robot window make sense ?

##### JoHn 10/31/2019 14:59:34
Oh, sure, I am checking the robot window. Give a minute üòÅ


Hi `@David Mansolino`, the values shown in the robot window make sense. Thank you very much for your input. I am trying to locate the problem. Will update you later on.

How can I re-open the HTML window from Webots once closed?

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 10/31/2019 16:10:59
`@JoHn` you're welcome.


`@JoanGerard` from Webots you should be able to re-open it the exact same way you open it the first time (either double-clicking on the robot or right click => Show Robot Window)

##### JoanGerard 10/31/2019 16:14:28
thanks!


I am trying to create my first HTML window but I receive this error message while starting the simulation.

`@David Mansolino` Here are the clips. Sorry it took some time.

The rock on the left is the standard Rock10cm as defined by  webots. The one on the right is the same with coordinate points scaled by 4x to make Rock40cm. In this environment I have created this happens. The left rock is perfect in dynamics by the right one is sinking, etc.

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 11/01/2019 07:32:42
`@JoanGerard`, are you sure your robot windows is at the correct location, i.e. `YOUR\_PROJECT/plugins/robot\_windows/YOUR\_ROBOT\_WINDOW\_NAME' and the folder contains a YOUR\_ROBOT\_WINDOW\_NAME.html file ?


`@buzzlightyear` as any regular program you can simply do a printf (i.e. `printf("Hello World\n");`)


`@Sohil` that's indeed strange, would you agree sending us your Rock40cm PROTO file so that we can test ?

##### JoHn 11/01/2019 15:49:37
Hi `@David Mansolino`, I have fixed the GPS problem. We did something wrong in the transformation üòÇ. Thanks a lot for your help. I'd like to ask one more question, because I am doing the control of vehicles via ROS. When the vehicles move, is there a way that moves the screen automatically, so that the vehicles can always be shown in the screen, and it doesn't need us to move (zoom in or out) the screen manually.

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 11/01/2019 15:50:31
Hi `@JoHn`,


Yes, select your robot and hit F5.


You can also select your robot and go to the View menu of Webots to select either "Follow Object" or "Follow Object and Rotate". You will quickly understand the difference by trying both options.

##### JoHn 11/01/2019 15:55:56
Hi `@Olivier Michel`, thank you very much for your help. It does track the vehicle movement. Great.


You guys have a nice weekend!

do you know what is the equivalent of wbu\_default\_robot\_window\_configure function for python?

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 11/01/2019 16:17:50
Let me check


Unforunately it seems the 'wbu\_default\_robot\_window\_*' functions are not  available in other languages than C, but it should be possible to add them, would you be interested in doing this ?

##### JoanGerard 11/01/2019 16:25:49
This function configures the robot window only right? I think that I may need it in the future but for the moment it's ok

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 11/01/2019 16:30:43
Yes exactly this is just if you want to 'inherit' from the default robot window, but you can of course create your own custom robot-window without using this function.

##### JoanGerard 11/01/2019 16:33:57
an other question, is there any way of watching to the console.log printed messages when using a robot window?

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 11/01/2019 16:36:46
If I am not wrong they are supposed to be displayed in the Webots Console


I juste tried and it seems to work fine.


By the way, you should probably have a look at the 'custom\_robot\_window.wbt' world which is a very simple example of custom robot window.

##### JoanGerard 11/01/2019 17:15:19
You're right. Thank you!

##### Xiangxiao 11/01/2019 17:53:50
Hello, I am doing simulation of fish-like robot swimming in fluid water. I am doing the fluid water based on the sample of Webots (floating\_geometries.wbt). In the sample, the water flow contains two components, including the DEF FLOWING\_WATER fluid (defining the physics of water flow) and DEF WATER\_FLOWING\_ANIMATION robot (defining the visual behavior/animation of water flow). In FLOWING\_WATER fluid, I can define the velocity of water flow. In the controller of WATER\_FLOWING\_ANIMATION robot, I can define the speed of the animation that simulate the water flow. I would like to know that how can I induce [the parameter of velocity of physical water flow in FLOWING\_WATER fluid] into [the controller of WATER\_FLOWING\_ANIMATION robot]? I want to do this since I would like to correlate the physical velocity of water flow to the playing-speed of animation.


Thanks in advance

i have the same issue..there is any solution???

##### Stefania Pedrazzi [cyberbotics] 11/03/2019 12:39:49
hi `@HiguchiNakamura` and `@Alexx` , the motion editor is currently not available with the new HTML window.


In Webots R2019b is still possible to use the old Qt robot window (deprecated) which contains the MotionEditor by changing the Robot.window field from the default value "generic" to "generic\_window"


Note that the "window" field is not exposed for the Nao PROTO, i.e. you have to modify the Nao.proto file.


`@smg` I coudl successfully install and run Webots on archlinux with Gnome desktop environemnt. Which (if any) desktop environment are you using?

##### Alexx 11/03/2019 12:56:57
where can i find the Robot.window field to change the "generic" to "generic\_window"? when i double click on robot it appears a window with name "Generic robot window". In this window there are all the tabs expect motion editor


`@Stefania Pedrazzi`

%end

##### Stefania Pedrazzi [cyberbotics] 11/04/2019 07:00:33
`@Alexx` has I wrote in the previous message, the "window" field is not exposed in the Nao PROTO (see PROTO description [https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/proto](https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/proto)). So you have to:


1. right-click on the Nao node in the scene tree and choose the "View PROTO source" item in the context menu;

2. add the line `window "generic_window"` at line 67 just after the `Robot {`

3. save the Nao.proto file in the "protos" folder in your project folder (see the description of the structure of the Webots project folder [https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/the-standard-file-hierarchy-of-a-project](https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/the-standard-file-hierarchy-of-a-project))


Alternatively instead of modifying the Nao PROTO node, you can also convert it to base nodes (right-click on the Nao node in the scene tree and choose "Convert to Base Node(s)") and then change the Robot.window field.


`@Xiangxiao` in case of the `floating_geometry.wbt` I think that the water animation speed was empirically on and not using a precise formula.

If you want that when you change the fluid properties also the animation speed changes I would suggest you to use a Robot with supervisor capabilities (`Robot.supervisor` field set to TRUE) so that in the controller you can read the `Fluid` properties and use them to compute the animation speed.

##### RossBatten 11/04/2019 07:38:38
Hi, I'm struggling with getting any kind of supervisor controller functionality working in my world.  If I remove the normal supervisor features and treat the controller as a simple robot only declaring it as a supervisor it works fine but the moment I try to use something as simple as setLabel(...) the simulation freezes and I get a spinning wheel and have to restart.  Any idea what's going on?


I'm building the controller in visual studio with no errors


I have the robot set to have supervisor status

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 11/04/2019 07:50:28

`@RossBatten`: Can you check that your `Robot` node has the `supervisor` field set to `TRUE`?

##### RossBatten 11/04/2019 07:52:44
Yes it does


If it's set to false I get an actual error message.  In this case it's simply freezing and I have to restart webots

Can you share the source code of your controller?

##### RossBatten 11/04/2019 07:54:05
Sure, what's the best way to do that here?

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 11/04/2019 07:54:38
For example on a gist: [https://gist.github.com/](https://gist.github.com/)


(if you have a github account)

##### RossBatten 11/04/2019 07:55:30

Like it's 30 lines max

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 11/04/2019 07:55:50
Yes, just copy/paste it on a gitst and that will be fine.


BTW, did you try to compile your code from the Webots built-in editor?

##### RossBatten 11/04/2019 07:58:09
I didn't, no

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 11/04/2019 08:02:41
Thanks, I will inspect your code and try to reproduce the problem. I have a meeting now, so, I will get back to you after that.

##### RossBatten 11/04/2019 08:03:19
OK no problem.  I probably won't be able to get back to this until tomorrow.

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 11/04/2019 10:06:00
`@RossBatten`: I could test your code from the Webots IDE on Windows 10 and it works as expected. I had to comment out the `lds[i] -> enable(timeStep);` line because the sensors were not found in my test world and this line was crashing the controller, but once that was commented out, everything was working as expected and I could see the "Hello" string displayed in the 3D view.


I did the same from Visual Studio 2019 and it worked as well.

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 11/04/2019 11:39:23
The way you get the motor is wrong, you have to get them like this:

```

##### HE110 11/04/2019 11:40:00
thanks,let me try

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 11/04/2019 11:40:14
You should probably follow this tutorial about controlling the e-puck robot: [https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/tutorial-4-more-about-controllers](https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/tutorial-4-more-about-controllers)

It is available in Python too.

You're welcome

##### RossBatten 11/05/2019 01:58:41
`@Olivier Michel`  I don't understand what's going on then.  I've tried running the same controller now on two different PCs, one windows 10, one linux, visual studio and webots internal editor/cmake builder and the same crash occurs every time.  If I omit the label line it works fine but if I include it or any other supervisor controller command it crashes the whole of webots on play.


I was only able to get it working in a C code controller.  At least I can move ahead with it

##### Stefania Pedrazzi [cyberbotics] 11/05/2019 07:27:15
`@RossBatten` could you add all your project files to the gitst? at least the world file and any another controllers/plugins that you are using?

How can i sleep 1s in controller by C?

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 11/05/2019 08:23:35
`@HE110` do you want the simulation to continue or to wait for 1s too?

##### HE110 11/05/2019 08:24:06
Wait

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 11/05/2019 08:24:27
ok, which programming language are you using?

##### HE110 11/05/2019 08:24:32
C

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 11/05/2019 08:25:00
In that case you can use simply the 'sleep' function for example: [https://linux.die.net/man/3/sleep](https://linux.die.net/man/3/sleep)

##### HE110 11/05/2019 08:25:48

`@mkjhnb` did you set the tilt angle to 0?


`@juanluciano` which version of the robot are you using? Have you tried to press the uninstall button (just to the right to the one you pressed) and the re-start remote-control again?

##### juan luciano 11/06/2019 14:22:55

When I do

targetY = float(params["yPositionFactor"]) * targetY

pitchPID = PID(float(params["pitch\_Kp"]), float(params["pitch\_Ki"]), float(params["pitch\_Kd"]), setpoint=targetY)



The code works.

If I do

pitchPID = PID(float(params["pitch\_Kp"]), float(params["pitch\_Ki"]), float(params["pitch\_Kd"]), setpoint=float(params["yPositionFactor"]) * targetY)



Can anybody let me know any root cause of this? I would greatly appreciate any help


pitchPID = PID(float(params["pitch\_Kp"]), float(params["pitch\_Ki"]), float(params["pitch\_Kd"]), setpoint=float(params["yPositionFactor"]) * targetY)



With this, position hold locks at wrong coordinates

`@Prasad` Hi


again üôÇ


I would recommend to translate EXACTLY mavic2pro.c into Python, and THEN (when it's working smoothly) bring modifications.

##### Prasad 11/07/2019 10:34:14
Thanks `@Fabien Rohrer` üôÇ I translated mavic2pro.c .However, the quadcopter was flipping and I couldn't work with it. That is when I studied and introduced control systems.

##### Fabien Rohrer [Moderator] 11/07/2019 10:36:40
In theory, the C controller can be translated to Python, there is a one-to-one match. So I guess you missed some point.


By the way..

##### Prasad 11/07/2019 10:37:27
Correct. That is what I guess and [https://github.com/PrasadNR/Webots-Quadcopter-Python-SITL/commit/737eaa870e448c24365b4b6dbb6fa52b0494f576](https://github.com/PrasadNR/Webots-Quadcopter-Python-SITL/commit/737eaa870e448c24365b4b6dbb6fa52b0494f576) was the commit

##### Fabien Rohrer [Moderator] 11/07/2019 10:37:44
The mavic sample world has also some physics settings:

=> You should copy the WorldInfo node from there.


It may explain some mismatch

##### Prasad 11/07/2019 10:39:21
Yes. I guess so. Thanks `@Fabien Rohrer` ! üôÇ If that works or any of the code solutions work, I will definitely reply back

##### Fabien Rohrer [Moderator] 11/07/2019 10:40:51
Yes, it would be awesome.


Basically, you need to create a pull request from your Webots fork on github targeting our main branch.

##### Prasad 11/08/2019 09:51:22
Hey guys, I am almost done with my repo and thinking about contributing with official Python example. I was not able to get Emitter and Receiver working with Python. Could anybody help?



I am doing



emitter = Emitter("emitter")

while (robot.step(timestep) != -1):

    emitter.send('x'.encode())



and at the receiver



receiver = Receiver("receiver")

receiver.enable(TIME\_STEP)

while (robot.step(timestep) != -1):

    print(receiver.getData())


It doesn't matter if I use bytes() in Python or struct with message unpack. I am getting errors all along. Could anyone let me know?

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 11/08/2019 09:52:12
Did you try to use strings instead?

##### Prasad 11/08/2019 09:52:27
Yes. That was the first thing I tried. Sorry. I forgot to mention


I tried int and float too. None of them worked


Tried receiver.nextData() also


*nextPacket()

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 11/08/2019 09:53:19
Please have a look at Webots/projects/languages/python/controllers/slave and Webots/projects/languages/python/controllers/driver


This is a good example of using emitters and receivers in Python.

##### Prasad 11/08/2019 09:54:48
Oh. That should give me a head start. Thank you!


Thank you `@Olivier Michel` I was able to integrate communication. I was doing GPS based object tracking. However, I am facing one issue with ODE Physics engine. I keep getting the following warning.



WARNING: The current physics step could not be computed correctly. Your world may be too complex. If this problem persists, try simplifying your bounding object(s), reducing the number of joints, or reducing WorldInfo.basicTimeStep.



Repo link: [https://github.com/PrasadNR/Webots-Quadcopter-Python-SITL](https://github.com/PrasadNR/Webots-Quadcopter-Python-SITL)


If I set the TIME\_STEP too large like 64, rover works properly. But, quadcopter flips due to PID update rate. If I set TIME\_STEP to 4 or 8, quadcopter works. But, rover fails to follow the line


Question here is should I set the same time step for both quadcopter and rover? What about communication sync?

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 11/08/2019 11:29:44
No, you can use different control step for different robots, this is not a problem.

##### Prasad 11/08/2019 11:29:55
Oh ok. Let me try that!

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 11/08/2019 11:30:11
Beware however that the control step should be multiple of the WorldInfo.basicTimeStep.

##### Prasad 11/08/2019 11:30:35
Oh ok! I will check that out

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 11/08/2019 11:30:41
Eg., if you WorldInfo.basicTimeStep is 8 ms, your controllers may have a control time step of 8, 16, 24, 32, etc.

##### Prasad 11/08/2019 11:31:09
Ok. I guess the world has 32. That is why I was getting that error. Awesome. Thanks!


For basicTimeStep 8, rover physics is behaving differently

Should I raise a bug report on that?

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 11/08/2019 13:47:41
It's normal to observe a small difference in the simulation result when you change the basic time step. If that difference is big when changing only moderately the time step, then it is certainly worth a bug report.

##### Prasad 11/08/2019 13:48:20
The rover is getting stuck and I am not able to get the simulation of both quadcopter and rover working. I guess I will raise a bug report for now


In connection with [https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots/issues/1081](https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots/issues/1081) , could anyone let me know any tips as to how I can fix it for now?

##### Tahir [Moderator] 11/10/2019 10:41:21
ROS controller is written in C++. Its upon you how you handle your program on ROS side. From Webots everything is available in the form of Services, now its upon you how you handle it wither in Python or C++.

##### threeal 11/10/2019 10:58:10
i mean the custom ros controller, not the ros controller that been provided by webots

##### Tahir [Moderator] 11/10/2019 11:18:48
Well, I am not good in roscpp but just going through the ros folder provided by Webots also includes roscpp as well.


So I think you can try to code with that and see what does it says and than fix that

i am new to this software where can i get the tutorials?

##### JFXian 11/11/2019 00:30:37
On the official website, [https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/getting-started-with-webots](https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/getting-started-with-webots)

##### Stefania Pedrazzi [cyberbotics] 11/11/2019 07:06:40
`@JFXian`: about closed kinematics loops, you can model them inserting a SolidReference node ([https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/solidreference](https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/solidreference)) in the joint endPoint field. This node is a reference to an existing Solid and allows you to reuse the same Solid node twice in the model.

For an example you can look at the `projects/samples/demows/worlds/stewart_platform.wbt` example ([https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/samples-demos#stewart\_platform-wbt](https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/samples-demos#stewart_platform-wbt))


`@threeal`: to get the control PID values you can use the Supevisor API function to read the node field value. There is no Motor API function to retrieve it directly.


`@threeal`: What do you mean exactly by "support for ros controller in c++"? You can already implement a ros controller as webots controller in c++ as we did when implementing the default ROS interface procided by Webots.


`@chamandana` please pay attention that the youBot omni wheels only work if the WorldInfo.contactProperties of the world are set correctly. You should open the default `youbot.wbt` world and copy them in your world.

##### threeal 11/11/2019 08:17:20
`@Stefania Pedrazzi` so how is the relation between supervisor and the robot? and does it still written in robot controller?

##### Stefania Pedrazzi [cyberbotics] 11/11/2019 08:18:34
You can enable the Supervisor functionality in a robot controller by setting the `Robot.supervisor` field to TRUE

##### threeal 11/11/2019 08:19:34

That is great

##### Fabien Rohrer [Moderator] 11/11/2019 14:56:36
I'm sorry, but this issue is difficult to follow because it reports several issues at the same time.


Could we discuss of them one by one?


1. Is my answer about timestep and mavic satisfying?


(I expect its normal to not have a perfect match, because the constants are hardcoded. The controller is not robust enough to support this. So setting the constants exactly as in mavic\_2\_pro.wbt should solve your issue.)


respectfully üòâ

##### Prasad 11/11/2019 15:04:51
Yes `@Fabien Rohrer`  I agree with you! However, as it is just PID controller, I believe, it will converge to the position without the need of world parameters like dampening etc. (I am deliberately avoiding too many parameters) + if I set `targetX` and `targetY` to -1.0 and -1.0, the quadcopter flies rock solid


And you are also right regarding several issues. I would help you with whatever info I can provide! Let me see if I can break that issue

##### Fabien Rohrer [Moderator] 11/11/2019 15:12:09
Ok, let's focus on this first.


I added damping to render the controller more easy to write. It may indeed lose some physics accuracy doing so. For sure, in reality, their is some damping, but certainly not so big.


So you're right telling that world parameters should not affect so much the simulation.


Is it satisfying? Could we "close" this topic?

##### Prasad 11/11/2019 15:17:25
> So you're right telling that world parameters should not affect so much the simulation.



You are right! I meant that.



> Could we "close" this topic?



Sure!

##### Fabien Rohrer [Moderator] 11/11/2019 15:17:35
Ok.


The second topic is about the pioneer control, right?


Do you still have issues with this?

##### Prasad 11/11/2019 15:17:58
Yes


> Do you still have issues with this?



Yes

##### Fabien Rohrer [Moderator] 11/11/2019 15:18:42
If I understand well: when the basictimestep is modified, it affects the robot speed, right?

##### Prasad 11/11/2019 15:18:54
To some extent yes!


Sometimes, the rover gets stuck also. Either the rover gets stuck or the camera flickers and goes gray in certain red regions

##### Fabien Rohrer [Moderator] 11/11/2019 15:20:24
Are the camera values used to control somehow the motor speeds?

##### Prasad 11/11/2019 15:21:08
Camera values as in? Image processing? Yes. I am using image processing to control motor speeds.

Camera values as in parameters like width and height? No. Those are fixed

##### Fabien Rohrer [Moderator] 11/11/2019 15:22:21
yes, I meant image processing.


So, the first thing to determine is that: can you move the robot smoothly when the image processing is not used?

`@threeal`: ok, now I better understand what you mean. For C++ there is the complete standard `ros` controller implementation ([https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots/tree/revision/projects/default/controllers/ros](https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots/tree/revision/projects/default/controllers/ros))

The C++ files corresponding to the `ros_controller.py` file are defined here [https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots/tree/revision/projects/languages/ros/webots\_ros](https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots/tree/revision/projects/languages/ros/webots_ros). It also contains a sample of the CMakeLists.txt file that you could adapt to write your simple ros example in cpp. 

Other instructions for the standard ROS controller in cpp that you could need are described here [https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/using-ros#standard-ros-controller](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/using-ros#standard-ros-controller)

##### Stefania Pedrazzi [cyberbotics] 11/11/2019 15:54:38
yes, you can reuse it. You should also copy the `include` folder.

##### threeal 11/11/2019 16:14:12
what about the msg and srv? will it able to builds them? and where will it located? and how can i include it to my main ros workspace?

if you copy the include folder in your controller folder, then they should be built automatically (even if probably you won't need all of them)


To include them into the ros workspace you just have to copy the msg and srv folders into the catkin workspace.


Here are some old instructions to setup manually the webots\_ros package (before it was published in ros): [https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/tutorial-7-using-ros?version=cyberbotics:R2019a#webots\_ros-package-installation](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/tutorial-7-using-ros?version=cyberbotics:R2019a#webots_ros-package-installation)

thank you `@Stefania Pedrazzi`

##### machinekoder 11/12/2019 06:54:44
I would like to simulate a 3D/ToF camera. For this purpose I've set up a sim with with a Lidar device. The ToF cam has a resolution of 224x171 and FOV of 62x45deg, I've entered that in Webots. So far so good.



When I now try to use the sim with a `ros` controller, the controller just crashes. I supect that this is due to the high layer resolutions, since it doesn't crash when I reduce the layers. 



Any ideas how to resolve this?


I've shared the sim here: [https://wolke.roessler.systems/s/q3Map9kMnPxwYA6](https://wolke.roessler.systems/s/q3Map9kMnPxwYA6)

`@machinekoder` Hi,


Correct me if I'm wrong, but I think that using a Webots RangeFinder would be closer than a Webots Lidar node to simulate a 3D/ToF camera:


[https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/samples-devices#range\_finder-wbt](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/samples-devices#range_finder-wbt)


[https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/rangefinder](https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/rangefinder)


.. and more efficient

##### Hayden Woodger 11/12/2019 07:38:53
Could somebody please tell what a 3D/Tof is? xD

##### Fabien Rohrer [Moderator] 11/12/2019 07:39:11
That said, there is no reason that the ROS controller crashes when increasing the number of layers.


Unless you reach a limitation with your GPU.


=> what is your GPU? are you above the minimal requirements? [https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/system-requirements](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/system-requirements) Are your drivers up-to-date?


> Could somebody please tell what a 3D/Tof is? xD


It's a camera which can retrieve the depth information for each pixel, using time of flight: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time-of-flight\_camera](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time-of-flight_camera)

##### Hayden Woodger 11/12/2019 07:44:52
Thank you for your response Fabien. In your opinion, is this the fastest method in terms of response time?

##### Fabien Rohrer [Moderator] 11/12/2019 07:45:24
Yes, we use to use this way to simulate kinect cameras for example.

##### Hayden Woodger 11/12/2019 07:45:54
Used to? So what method would you use now?

##### Fabien Rohrer [Moderator] 11/12/2019 07:45:59
like here (old movie): [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Fjyu\_wzIgc](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Fjyu_wzIgc)


This method is still in use (sorry, it was not what I meant.)

##### Hayden Woodger 11/12/2019 07:52:37
That's awesome üôÇ  I see what you mean now, thank you! I'm curious, did you use ikpy for the kinematics on the arm?

##### Fabien Rohrer [Moderator] 11/12/2019 07:54:45
Not in this example. This is a "home-made" IK algorithm: [https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots/blob/master/projects/robots/kuka/youbot/libraries/youbot\_control/src/arm.c#L184](https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots/blob/master/projects/robots/kuka/youbot/libraries/youbot_control/src/arm.c#L184)


At this time, ikpy was not released üôÇ


However, we provide another example using ikpy:

##### Fabien Rohrer [Moderator] 11/12/2019 07:57:29
Yes, this Python module is amazing


(but a bit slow üò¶ )

##### Hayden Woodger 11/12/2019 07:58:19
Do you think so?


If you don't synconize the controller it'll go fast.

##### Fabien Rohrer [Moderator] 11/12/2019 08:00:25
Yes, it was slowing down the ABB simulation, I had to reduce the controller rate to be able to run in real time. It's not very annoying in such demo, but I dreamed to use it to control the legs of a spider robot, and in this case, I think it's too slow üò¶


> f you don't synconize the controller it'll go fast.


Good point

##### Hayden Woodger 11/12/2019 08:04:31
I have applied the inverse kinematics to each arm and leg of Atlas. When I try and run the simulation, whilst telling the arms and legs to go to new x,y,z position, it dramatically slows down the simulation.

##### Fabien Rohrer [Moderator] 11/12/2019 08:05:21
Yes, IK is for sure a slow task.


On the other hand, I have not a lot experiment in other libraries than ikpy

##### machinekoder 11/12/2019 08:05:52
`@Fabien Rohrer` I assumed the same, but the RangeFinder doesn't give me PointCloud. So the Lidar device seems to be the better fit.

##### Hayden Woodger 11/12/2019 08:06:16

Your GPU should work well with Webots.


To have a stack on linux, probably that the ROS controller should be build in debug mode... It begins to be too difficult to solve here.


Could I ask you to fill a bug report here:


[https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots/issues](https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots/issues)


With info about your system (Webots version, OS version, etc.)?


It would be much simpler to track this issue which seems to be a bug in our ROS controller..

##### machinekoder 11/12/2019 08:15:50
Okay I will. My guess is that has something to do with the amount of published "layer" laser scan topics, since reducing the layers fixes the issue

##### Fabien Rohrer [Moderator] 11/12/2019 08:17:19
Yes, certainly. But this does not explain the crash. I would be on a bad memory management somewhere. But we should be able reproduce it in order to fix it.


Thank you for the bug report.

I'm having trouble getting pycharm to work with webots, getting an error that it can't find \_controller that gets imported in the controller.py script


From what I can see, the \_controller.pyd file is in the same directory as the controller.py file so how is it able to find one but not the other?


For reference, I'm using anaconda python 3.7.5 in windows


Any help I can get would be much appreciated


Both files are in the source root directory: C:\Program Files\Webots\lib\python37


ImportError: DLL load failed: The specified module could not be found.


Does this mean the file was found but the module contained was unable to be read?  Or does it mean the dll couldn't be found


?

##### Hayden Woodger 11/15/2019 00:49:52
I had the same issue, didn't find a solution so


i had to go back to python 2.7

##### RossBatten 11/15/2019 00:56:24
I have been reading that this error comes up when the dll is compiled in a different python version to the one you're using


Could be it's compiled in 2.7


That wouldn't make sense since the folder the \_controller.pyd file resides in is Webots/lib/python37


I ended up getting it to work by swiching to vscode environment.  Still unsure of the cause

##### Stefania Pedrazzi [cyberbotics] 11/18/2019 12:18:22
Hi `@JoanGerard`, the issue with the GPU detection is not related to the problem connecting to the simulation server. You can check which GPU is detected by webots by running `webots --sysinfo` in a terminal on the simulation server. Are your NVIDIA drivers up-to-date?


For the connection issue, a first thing to test is to start webots manually on the simulation server and try to connect to it directly using the `streaming_viewer` page ([https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots/tree/revision/resources/web/streaming\_viewer](https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots/tree/revision/resources/web/streaming_viewer))


You can retrieve the exact command used by the simulation server script to start Webots in the logs (usually `<WEBOTS_INSTALLATION>/resources/web/server/log/simulation/output.log`) and just remove the world path


Please try it and let us know what you get.

> ERROR: Error when creating the TCP streaming server: Cannot set the server in listen mode: The address is protected

there is clearly an issue whith the port. It seems that the address you are trying to listen on is available only to privileged applications (i.e. application ran as root).

You should check your network configurations and change them

##### Nocturnal Warfare 11/18/2019 19:11:58
`@Olivier Michel` i just tried using the terrain generator and still nothing seems to be happening. Am I just using it wrong? You just scale the map to what you want to generate then hit generate right?

##### threeal 11/18/2019 20:05:30
does webots support ros 2?

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 11/18/2019 20:28:35
`@Nocturnal Warfare`: I tried it now and it works for me, but it takes time. Just below the map, you should see a counter increasing until it displays "Ready" and the Webots fill will appear in the text area below.

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 11/18/2019 20:36:03
`@threeal`, yes, we have already an interface with ROS2: [http://wiki.ros.org/webots\_ros2](http://wiki.ros.org/webots_ros2)

We are still improving it, you can follow the development and get the latest version here: [https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots\_ros2.git](https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots_ros2.git)

##### threeal 11/18/2019 21:21:42
does the performance better in ros 2 or is it the same?

##### Nocturnal Warfare 11/18/2019 21:53:58
`@Olivier Michel` oh I got that working now thanks, but the staticmap.png doesn't work for me, it just says Google maps platform rejected your request

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 11/18/2019 22:16:50
`@threeal` yes we do expect a better integration and performance, however since the interface is still in development we can't give precise measurements for now.

##### JoanGerard 11/19/2019 01:43:46
So when I execute webots manually from the simulator server and I use the stream\_viewer example everything works good. 



The server.sh file needs to be executed with sudo command otherwise the simulator\_server.py crashes. The problem arises when the instance of Webots is lunched due to the connexion of a new client cause it is been executed as root. Do you have any idea on how I can solve this?

##### Stefania Pedrazzi [cyberbotics] 11/19/2019 07:20:27
`@JoanGerard` it is a bad practice to run Webots as root. So please make sure that it works when you start Webots manually without root privileges. Then it seems that you installed Webots from the snap package. We never tested the streaming server with the snap version of Webots and it is very likely that it is doesn't work. I would suggest you to install Webots using the debian or tarball package [https://www.cyberbotics.com/download](https://www.cyberbotics.com/download)

E puck cant move

##### Fabien Rohrer [Moderator] 11/19/2019 09:19:23
first of all, you need to replace time.sleep() by robot.step(time\_step)


with time\_step = int(robot.getBasicTimeStep())


secondly, your controller quits, because "t" reaches 10, and enter in the "quit"  section (the loop is broken)

##### HE110 11/19/2019 09:22:06
Im going to try it,thank u


How can i control it to move two circles?


Two circles likes "8"


TIME\_STEP is always 32


from controller import Motor

from controller import Robot

rbt=Robot()



MAX\_SPEED = 6.28

TIME\_STEP = 32

left = Motor("left wheel motor")

right = Motor("right wheel motor")



right.setVelocity(6)

left.setVelocity(3)

while 1:

    right.setVelocity(6)

    left.setVelocity(3)


It is always still

##### Fabien Rohrer [Moderator] 11/19/2019 09:46:46
It's still because you don't step the simulator: cf my comment above.


your loop is a blocking infinite loop.


to do a 8, you have to do a circle, then switch the velocties.


Let me show you...

##### HE110 11/19/2019 09:49:00
Thanks...


It is  toooooooo hard

##### Fabien Rohrer [Moderator] 11/19/2019 09:53:03
>>> from controller import Robot



robot = Robot()

timestep = int(robot.getBasicTimeStep())

TIME\_FOR\_A\_CIRCLE = 10.0   # 10 seconds to do a perfect circle? => to adjust



left = robot.getMotor("left wheel motor")

right = robot.getMotor("right wheel motor")

left.setPosition(float('inf'))  # Set motor in speed mode

right.setPosition(float('inf'))  # Set motor in speed mode



while robot.step(timestep) != -1:

    time = robot.getTime()

    if time < TIME\_FOR\_A\_CIRCLE:

      right.setVelocity(6)

      left.setVelocity(3)

    elif time < 2.0 * TIME\_FOR\_A\_CIRCLE:

      right.setVelocity(3)

      left.setVelocity(6)

    else:

      print('quit')

      break


I didn't test, but this controller should do a "8". You should only adjust TIME\_FOR\_A\_CIRCLE

Hi guys, I'm making a procedural proto which have to add several solid to the children field of the robot. I'd like to give a unique name to these solid using lua.


Robot {

    children [

      %{ for i = 0, 6 do }%

        ARTag {

but I get an error: Expected string literal, found 'top\_tag\_0'.

##### Fabien Rohrer [Moderator] 11/19/2019 11:06:36
Yes, I see.


The point is to add a \" character at the beginning and at the end of your string, like this:


>>> %{= "\\"toptag" .. tostring(i) .. "\\"" }%


Otherwise the name is not protected correctly, and is interpreted by the wbt parser.

##### Fabien Rohrer [Moderator] 11/19/2019 13:25:24

In the procedural PROTO, you have access to these modules: [https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots/tree/revision/resources/lua/modules/webots](https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots/tree/revision/resources/lua/modules/webots)


wbrotation.lua deals with some typical rotations issues you may have with Webots.


Here is a typical usage: [https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots/blob/revision/projects/devices/sick/protos/SickLdMrs.proto#L46](https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots/blob/revision/projects/devices/sick/protos/SickLdMrs.proto#L46)

But apparently, the current lidar will not work because the laser beams are shooting to the ground and the sky.


Is there any chance to modify the default coordinate system of the lidar? Thanks a lot!

##### Sohil 11/20/2019 04:25:36
Hi guys! I am working with Webots and ROS. I wanted to know if there is any neat way to publish transforms for suppose between cameras and robot?

##### Stefania Pedrazzi [cyberbotics] 11/20/2019 07:17:20
`@JoHn` it is not possible to change the coordinate system of the Lidar device itself. The tilt will always be along the X axis of the Lidar device node and rotation along the Y axis (see the documentation [https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/lidar#field-summary](https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/lidar#field-summary)). About the graphical shape, you can add a Tranform inbetween to change it and if you need to change the coordinates of the Lidar device values you have to do it manually in the controller program.


`@Sohil` which transform do you want to publish? Currently it is not possible to retrieve directly the transform matrix from a parent node to a descendant node using the Webots API, but you can compute it in your controller program based on the camera and robot global position and orientation ([https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/supervisor?tab-language=ros#wb\_supervisor\_node\_get\_orientation](https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/supervisor?tab-language=ros#wb_supervisor_node_get_orientation))

Hi guys! I've made several protos (1 folder per proto) in the main "protos" folder of my webots project. When I try to make another proto using these last ones, Webots console outputs: "error: Skipped unknown node "artag" or Proto". If I move all the protos in the same folder, I can reference them. What is the best way to make a proto that can be used by several protos ?

##### Fabien Rohrer [Moderator] 11/20/2019 13:18:26
Hi clement.


I'm checking, at some point we had a mechanism to add a resource folder.


Ok, we have indeed a mechanism to set supplementary paths in order to search for general protos: it's about to add a directory in the "Webots Preferences / General / Extra Project Path".


You could add there a path to a generic project directory containing your generic PROTOs. They should be defined in a "protos" directory (as usual in fact).

##### ClBaze 11/20/2019 13:59:36
It's working üôÇ . I suppose Webots saves its preferences to a file. Where can I find it ? I don't find it in its installation folder.

##### Fabien Rohrer [Moderator] 11/20/2019 14:03:00
Then the Webots preferences are stored into INI config files (one per Webots version) into your ~/.config/Cyberbotics directory. Please modify these files with care üòâ


This option is stored as a string under the "General/extraProjectsPath" key.

##### KamiRonin 11/20/2019 17:31:24
Greetings to all.

Has installed Webots r2019b rev1 on Windows 10 and followed lessons from the documentation.

But in a window 3D I see that textures are not displayed, and to consoles writes "/Webots/projects/default/worlds/textures/gray\_brick\_wall.jpg ' is not a power of two: rescaling it from-1x-1 to 0x0." And "projects/default/worlds/textures/gray\_brick\_wall.jpg ': Unsupported image format.".

But after all it is textures from the delivery and with them it is obvious everything is all right.

After some search has found out that jpg/jpeg a file of textures the program rejects ANY. Accepts normally only png!



To me that to convert all textures installed with the program in png?

##### Stefania Pedrazzi [cyberbotics] 11/21/2019 07:21:24
`@KamiRonin` no you don't have to convert the textures. JPG textures should work out of the box when installing Webots. If it doesn't then there could be some issues with the Webots installation or with your system PATH. I would first suggest you to download again Webots and reinstall it. If it still doesn't work we should inspect your environment settings.

##### KamiRonin 11/21/2019 07:29:15
`@Stefania Pedrazzi` I reinstalled Webots twice. Once it was installed in folder Users/MyName, at times (having deleted and having cleaned system), I have forced it to be installed in Program files.

After the second installation, there was a first start and textures from jpg files were visible, but right after an output and an input anew in the program - they any more were not shown.

What paths need to be registered in PATH for Webots?

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 11/21/2019 07:38:57
`@KamiRonin` I think I already saw this issue once, it was du to another libjpeg somewhere in the PATH. Please try cleanning your PATH environment variable before starting Webots.

There is the same implementation in the python example.wbt with the Robot teleportation, so have no idea what went wrong.


The Solid I used is imported through importMFNode when running the controller, and it is not saved in the world file, could that be the issue?

##### KamiRonin 11/21/2019 12:20:53
`@David Mansolino` I in all variables of environment PATH do not have paths to libraries libjpeg where to look - that it is necessary to register for Webots? Path addition to bin or lib has not helped folders Webots, he all as does not distinguish texture.

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 11/21/2019 12:50:30
`@Dorteel` , the fact that you did import the Solid before should not cause any issue. Would you agree to share your controller so that we can check what is happenning?


`@KamiRonin`, can you try temporarily just to remove completely all the content of your 'PATH' environment variable and then start Webots

##### KamiRonin 11/21/2019 12:52:19
`@David Mansolino` yes, one moment. I try...


`@David Mansolino` No, changes are not present. The same warnings also are not displayed textures.

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 11/21/2019 13:00:38

Ok, can you check on your computer if you have any 'libjpeg.dll' (or similar) in your 'Windows' folder (e.g. `C:\Windows\System32\libjpeg.dll`)?

##### KamiRonin 11/21/2019 13:16:48
`@David Mansolino` hm, no, any library has not found. That is it not complete with Webots? ok what to instal? It is enough to throw in Win a folder and all?

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 11/21/2019 13:19:07
I am sorry but I do not fully understand your last message, Webtos does provide everyhing that you need to run it. However, it might happen that other software badly designed already intalled on your computer can 'corrupt' your Windows by adding some libraries (in your case libjpeg) that are not compatible with the ones used by Webots.


`@Dorteel`, thank you I will try it and let you know

##### KamiRonin 11/21/2019 13:23:00
`@David Mansolino` I am sorry, for my English! No, for me any package, framework or the software environment has not installed libjpeg.dll in Windows. Review and processing of these files is carried on through something else. Now there is a question - which library from what framework to take and instal for me that Webots worked through it. GnuWin will approach?

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 11/21/2019 13:31:18
I am not familiar with GnuWin, but it is probably worth trying it.

##### KamiRonin 11/21/2019 13:34:15
Well, thanks big for the help! I will try different libraries for operation with jpeg, one question, Webots engine important concrete name or what or API functions of such library?

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 11/21/2019 13:52:15
`@Dorteel`, I had to slightly change your controller to make it run with my test world, but I have no crash. Can you please:

  1. Make sure that you are using the latest version of Webots.

  2. check that when you do both `obj = self.getFromDef('GOAL')` and `dest = obj.getField('translation')` None of the result are equal to `None`.


`@KamiRonin` you can find more info about the Webots API here: [https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/programming-fundamentals](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/programming-fundamentals)

##### KamiRonin 11/21/2019 13:56:59
`@David Mansolino` Well, thanks! I have thought that processing of rendering of textures, is function not from API Webots, and internal.

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 11/21/2019 13:58:39
Ah ok, sorry I misunderstood your question. Webots uses it's own rendering engine called wren: [https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots/tree/revision/include/wren](https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots/tree/revision/include/wren)

And it also uses Qt to load images.

##### Dorteel 11/21/2019 14:17:53
Thanks for taking the time to check it `@David Mansolino` . I have WeBots up-to-date, and none of the objects are None. However I gave the whole world and controller to my friend, and he could also run it perfectly, so have no idea what's wrong

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 11/21/2019 14:22:38
That's indeed strange, are you both runnin on the same OS ?

##### Dorteel 11/21/2019 14:25:31
yes, Ubuntu 18.04.3


But I checked it again and it works now, I have absolutely no idea why. Thanks for the help though!

Ok, good news. You're welcome for the help

##### nighthearing 11/21/2019 20:27:17
Hello. I'm about 1 hour into discovering webots. I've been looking for an approach to controlling the Logitech G29 steering wheel. Based on the documentation and input from `@Fabien Rohrer` back in September, it sounds like this is totally possible. I was hoping that I could just write a Python script to do this but my ignorance is getting the best of me. Should I be able to directly import the Joystick API (i.e., `from controller import Joystick API`) and connect to the steering wheel? 

```
from controller import Joystick
stick = Joystick()
stick.enable()
```

Edit: Also, can I bypass using the backend Webots server to use this API?

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 11/21/2019 22:42:13
HI `@nighthearing`, yes of course this is feasible. Please find an example that use the Joystick API to control a car using a G29 (or other steering wheel model) here (the example is in C++, but the Python API is exactly the same): [https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots/tree/revision/projects/vehicles/controllers/racing\_wheel](https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots/tree/revision/projects/vehicles/controllers/racing_wheel)


I am not sure to understand what you mean by bypassing Webots? If you want to use the Webots API you need Webots to run as it is Webots that is getting the joystick inputs and then transmit them to the controller.


If you want to get directly Joystick inputs from your script without using Webots you might use OIS ([https://github.com/wgois/OIS](https://github.com/wgois/OIS)) directly in your script.

##### Fabien Rohrer [Moderator] 11/22/2019 15:50:14
`@Dorteel` wouldn‚Äôt be simpler to merge your supervisor with your controller? After all, a supervisor is simply a special controller

##### ZOLTAN OPS 11/22/2019 15:50:42
Is there anyone that could give me a brief explanation of how i would write a basic compass that works on a robot? Using C

##### Fabien Rohrer [Moderator] 11/22/2019 15:52:45
`@lunarpulse` are you aware that you can write PROTO files programnatically? [https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/procedural-proto-nodes](https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/procedural-proto-nodes)


This is very convenient to create robots with optional parts, or to reuse subparts.


`@ZOLTAN OPS` you certainly look for this example: [https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots/blob/master/projects/samples/devices/worlds/compass.wbt](https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots/blob/master/projects/samples/devices/worlds/compass.wbt)


[https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots/blob/master/projects/samples/devices/controllers/compass/compass.c](https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots/blob/master/projects/samples/devices/controllers/compass/compass.c)

##### ZOLTAN OPS 11/22/2019 18:23:37
For the compass, is there an object i need to make a child of the robot to put a compass on the robot?

Also the first one you posted, is that all code for one compass or is there other stuff in there with it like motors. `@Fabien Rohrer`

##### Fabien Rohrer [Moderator] 11/22/2019 19:01:13
You can put the Compass directly into the Robot.children.


Yes, there are other stuff. If you open this world in Webots, it will be self explanatory üòâ


The robot is a blue 2 wheeled robot equipped with a motorized yellow arrow. The controller makes in order that the yellow arrow point always the north, using the compass feedback.

##### SimonDK 11/22/2019 23:59:03
I have a simulation connected with ROS and have access to the services. Is there a way to reset and pause the simulation from ROS?

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 11/23/2019 12:23:31
Hi `@SimonDK`, yes, you first have to make sure that the 'supervisor' field of your robot is set to 'TRUE' then you can use the supervisor services: 

[https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/supervisor?tab-language=ros#wb\_supervisor\_simulation\_set\_mode](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/supervisor?tab-language=ros#wb_supervisor_simulation_set_mode)

##### SimonDK 11/23/2019 15:12:59
Hi `@David Mansolino` , thanks for that. Have been trying it out, but every time I use any of those service calls from ROS, Webots crashes/freezes ü§îAny idea why? I am just running the Pioneer ROS example with Webots running on a remote machine. Everything works fine, can do mapping and control the robot.



Edit: figured it may be related to an issue on github, where the environment may freeze on Mac.

##### Prasad 11/24/2019 05:49:29
I am figuring out a workaround for the bug [https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots/issues/1081](https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots/issues/1081)

Question: Can I get the floor size in the controller?


I am using Python. Floor("floor") does not work. I was thinking about programmatically extracting the attributes of the floor in the controller


I have one more question. What does compass do? I believe it gives the orientation of the robot. But, where is the magnetic north? Is it the north of the webots floor or some north in infinity? Am I better off using gyro or should I use compass to get the orientation of the Pioneer rover?

##### ZOLTAN OPS 11/24/2019 13:06:44
`@Fabien Rohrer`  how would I open a world with compass.c?


im new to webots

##### Moumen 11/24/2019 16:24:20
How does webots work exactly


I'm kind of new to this stuff


I wanna just put some code and see if a robot moves


It probably doesn't work that way

##### SimonDK 11/24/2019 22:35:17
In the Supervisor controller, there are options for reset, pause, set real time, run, and fast. Isn't there an option to execute one simulation step like there is from the menu inside Webots?

##### Prasad 11/25/2019 02:49:54
Also, I am facing one terrible problem which is significantly consuming my development time (which I believe is unnecessary). The Y coordinates in Webots is flipped. There should be one option for the user to select the direction of Y coordinates (with reference to the floor). Should I raise an enhancement issue regarding the same?


Also, sorry to say this. Camera does not work properly. Rover gets stuck repeatedly. Coordinates are flipped. I do not think I can build a production ready SITL with Webots. I am quite frankly disappointed with flipped coordinates. I am thinking about archiving my repository citing the same reason by tomorrow. I would appreciate any insight/input.

##### Stefania Pedrazzi [cyberbotics] 11/25/2019 06:49:21
`@Prasad` yes it is possible to retrieve the Floor size. You have to use the Supervisor API ([https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/supervisor?tab-language=python#wb\_supervisor\_node\_get\_def](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/supervisor?tab-language=python#wb_supervisor_node_get_def)) to get the node and the  `Node.getField` (wb\_supervisor\_node\_get\_field) and `Field.getSFVec2` to retrieve the value of the "size" field. For an example you could for example look at the way the slave robots translation fields is read in the `projects/languages/python/worlds/example.wbt` sample simulation.


As documented in the `Compass` node documentation page ([https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/compass?tab-language=python](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/compass?tab-language=python)) the Webots north direction is the one set in the `WorldInfo.northDirection` field this is fully customizable and you are free to change it and adjust it to your needs. It "some north in infinity" and has nothing to do with the floor or any object in the scene. The Compass node works just fine in retrieving the orientation of a robot and that's what does: it returns the orientation of the device with respect to the `WorldInfo.northDirection`.


`@SimonDK` to execute just one step you can set the mode to REAL\_TIME, run the  `wb_robot_step(time)` function where `time` corresponds to the worlds basic time step (to execute one step) and then set the mode to PAUSE.


`@Moumen` to start with Webots I suggest you to read the Tutorials ([https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/tutorials](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/tutorials)). Here it is also explained how to program a robot. If after checking them it is still not clear how to run some code, please don't hesitate to ask again.


`@Prasad` in Webots it is possible to change the direction of the up vector and the direction of the north using the `WorldInfo.gravity` and `WorldInfo.northDirection` this should be sufficient to customize the global coordinates of the world. Please check the documentation `[https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/worldinfo](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/worldinfo)` and try to play with these parameters. If it still you cannot achieve what you want, then you could open an issue and we will evaluate it.


`@Prasad` I'm sorry that you have some issues using Webots and we are continuously trying to help you solving them. I'm also sure that there are workarounds for the coordinates issue and any other issue you will find. Please tell me if I'm wrong, but I have the feeling that you are trying to port one by one your Gazebo code in Webots and you are expecting that Webots works exactly the same way as Gazebo. But this is not the case, they are two different software that have been programmed independently following different standards. I think that to get the best from Webots (also in terms of performance) it would be better to try to understand how Webots works and adapt the code.

##### Dorteel 11/25/2019 08:28:25
Hi!

However, having troubles with implementing it with the supervisor class. I was trying double inheritance, but didn't succeeed so far, as both Robot and Gym requires a step() function. Might be that there is just an easy programming workaround I don't know about? Any suggestions?

##### Stefania Pedrazzi [cyberbotics] 11/25/2019 08:32:13
Hi `@Dorteel`, if I understand correctly your issue is simply than both base classes have the same method name , is it correct?


This is a common programming issue that could be solved by specifying the class in the call: [https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3810410/python-multiple-inheritance-from-different-paths-with-same-method-name](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3810410/python-multiple-inheritance-from-different-paths-with-same-method-name)

##### Dorteel 11/25/2019 08:34:19
Yes, the controller needs to inherit methods with the same name from both parents, and I'm not sure how it works when these methods are used by other packages.

##### Stefania Pedrazzi [cyberbotics] 11/25/2019 08:37:05
Calling `(super, Robot).step()` vs `(super, CustomEnv).step()` you should be able to control which function is called.

I used the blender addon for blender 2.79 to export it and transform it in proto


these "bugs" of display only appear when I use textures. Without any textures, webots render the model prefectly fine

##### Fabien Rohrer [Moderator] 11/25/2019 10:12:45
This is because your object is rendered as a transparent object.


You can simply solving this by removing the alpha layer from your textures. This is a condition to switch the objects into the transparent render queue.


To do so, simply open your image in Gimp, and select the "Layer / Transparency / Remove alpha chanel", and override your previous texture.


voila

##### Gautier A. 11/25/2019 10:15:11
Ok, I'm gonna try that ! Thank you !

##### Fabien Rohrer [Moderator] 11/25/2019 10:15:14
(do this for all your textures)

##### Gautier A. 11/25/2019 10:20:16
It worked, thank you a lot !


If I need to have a transparent texture on an object though, how would I have to do to not encounter this kind of problem ?

##### Fabien Rohrer [Moderator] 11/25/2019 10:24:09
transparent objects is a global issue in computer graphics, without perfect solutions.


Our solution is about to sort transparent objects according to their center, but not to sort polygons, because it has a big cost in term of performance.


This is good enough to render simple cases (rectangular glasses, etc.) but not to render well complex meshes.


we currently do not provide better solution. But it would be possible to change our rendering engine to optionnaly sort polygons (but we should see a big interest in this topic, which is currently not the case).

##### Gautier A. 11/25/2019 10:33:38
Ok, I totally understand your point of view

So, I have this proto node that generate some other other solid in its "children" thanks to some Lua. The  behavior of the proto in itself is what we excepted, the only thing is that we want to separate the "physics" of the different solid (exemple : At the end of the video, I apply a force on some of the mirror, and I would like that these mirrors "undocks" and just go the other way of the rest of the structure)

I would like my "robot" to not be considered as a "big object" by my physics engine but "multiple object" docked in a central one


Could I modelize the "docking" of these differents object on Webots (and the necessary force to seperate themselves from the central dock) ? If not, how could I do in order that, even if these objects are generated by a lua proto, they're considered separated and with differents physics ?

(I definitvely have to add a new background of space for such 0 gravity areas üôÇ )

##### Gautier A. 11/25/2019 11:02:58
It's the fact that it's treated as a "big object", instead of little small objects, in prescence of force that I would like to correct

That would be pretty nice  !

##### Fabien Rohrer [Moderator] 11/25/2019 11:05:14
You unfortunately reached a limitation of our PROTO system which can handle only one root node.


Because of this, and the fact that we do other assumptions on the top nodes, it seems unfortunately to be not possible to achieve this this way.


(our PROTO system should deal with multiple top nodes to be able to manage this case)


A better approach would be rather to create a PROTO per tile, and to assembly them using another mechanism, typically a Supervisor can import PROTO in a scene.

##### Stefania Pedrazzi [cyberbotics] 11/25/2019 11:11:01
What about using a Group as a top node? You will be able to add multiple independent Solid children nodes from the procedural PROTO

##### Fabien Rohrer [Moderator] 11/25/2019 11:11:56
You're right, but I'm not sure we support this. Is it possible to add Robot inside a Group?


I'm testing this right now.

##### Stefania Pedrazzi [cyberbotics] 11/25/2019 11:12:45
probably not,  just the Solid nodes

Do you have any suggestions?

##### Fabien Rohrer [Moderator] 11/25/2019 11:20:47
`@Gautier A.` `@Stefania Pedrazzi` I confirm that a Group does not solve the issue, because currently a Robot cannot be inserted in it (but a Solid can).


`@Gautier A.` I would say that a slot is more a matter on how two protos are connected together.


If you go in the way I suggest about to use a Supervisor to assembly the tiles, slots could be use to facilitate their assembly (cf. the tinkerbots examples)

We are aware of this severe issue, and we will do our best to solve it quickly: [https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots/issues/1118](https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots/issues/1118) You're welcome to share your expertise on this issue report. You should follow this issue to be informed on the fix progress.


Meanwhile, I can only advise you to use the heavy wb\_supervisor\_simulation\_reload() function instead.

Hello !

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 11/27/2019 09:26:04
Hi

##### Gautier A. 11/27/2019 09:26:37
So, I have a little problem I can't really make sense off


I would be very gratefull if you helped me understand the "unexpected behavior"

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 11/27/2019 09:27:16
Yes of course, what is this behavior?

##### Gautier A. 11/27/2019 09:28:28
I have a world in Webots that consists in a rail (a solid that can move in one axis compared to another solid in reference) and a connector is fixed to the end of the rail


and I put a robot (sample robot, abb I think) on the "end connector"


The unexpected behavior is that there seems to be "no constraint" on the Z axis : when a force is applied to the robotic arm, it just "kind off" seperate itself from the rest of the solid


But it's still the end point of the slider joint (when I move the slider joint, the "robotic arm" floating stop to float and moves accordingly to the joint)


Here's a video to show tou

Ok, thank you a lot ! üôÇ

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 11/27/2019 09:32:26
You're welcome


It seems the hierarchy of your nodes is somehow wrong. You have a root node that has Physics without bounding objcet (this doesn't make sense) and then another Solid in the children at the same level than the joint that have bounding object (same size than root Solid) but no Physics


Then in the children of your joint you have some useless transform and the endpoint Solid of the first joint doesn't have bounding objects and physics


You should try to:

  1. remove useless transform (it is pointless to put a transform as parent of a solid)


2. make sure all your Solids nodes (maybe except the root one) have both bounding object and physics set

##### Gautier A. 11/27/2019 09:54:26
Ok, that was a problem of physic node lacking üòÑ


Thank you so much !


But, by the way, Is it really necessary for the root node (robot) to have a bouding object ?

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 11/27/2019 09:55:09
You're welcome

##### Gautier A. 11/27/2019 09:55:17
It inherit the bouding object from its children, doesn't it ?


inherits*

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 11/27/2019 09:55:46
Yes it does if you have direct chidrens (not linked with a joint)

##### Gautier A. 11/27/2019 09:55:57
understood !


Thank you !


Hi again, I'm sorry to annoy you, I have another question üòÖ


Is it possible to import a proto node instead of a world using a supervisor ?

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 11/27/2019 15:20:27
Yes


You can import it using these functions: [https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/supervisor#wb\_supervisor\_field\_import\_mf\_node](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/supervisor#wb_supervisor_field_import_mf_node)

##### Gautier A. 11/27/2019 15:23:56
Thank you

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 11/27/2019 15:24:06
You're welcome

##### Gautier A. 11/27/2019 15:24:13
I tried again, but I can import a ".wbo" file but not a ".proto"


I don't really know why


(the .wbo file is just the proto exported)

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 11/27/2019 15:25:00
You can use the 'wb\_supervisor\_field\_import\_mf\_node\_from\_string' function and import a string like this one:

"MyProtoName { translation 0 0.5 0 ...}"

##### Gautier A. 11/27/2019 15:26:07
Ohhh, I see


Thank you !

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 11/27/2019 15:26:22
You're welcome

##### Gautier A. 11/27/2019 16:06:44
I'm sorry to bother you again, but it doesn't seems to work üòÖ


I'm trying to import a simple proto, like this
> **Attachment**: [Solid.proto](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/565154703139405824/649280061177987111/Solid.proto)

##### Fabien Rohrer [Moderator] 11/27/2019 16:08:07
You should call the file "MyProtoName.proto", and put it in "yourWebotsProject/protos/MyProtoName.proto"


Naming it Solid.proto is a bad idea üòâ

The frame also freezes, can't see anything moving while the recording is ongoing

##### Fabien Rohrer [Moderator] 11/28/2019 16:19:13
This warning occurs normally when no simulation steps occured between the beggining and the end of the movie recording.


A regular workflow is about to select "File / Make Movie...", click OK, run the simulation, select "File / Stop Movie", and finally choose the target file.


Some information should be displayed in the Webots console.


Once the target file is chosen, the movie creation takes a while (see the log in the console)


Please wait on the result before doing something else..

##### Dorteel 11/28/2019 16:22:54
Thank you, I'll try to do that!

##### Dorteel 11/28/2019 16:43:03
Same issue unfortunately, tried multiple times :/ I managed to create one video though, but can't play it and it and the robot was frozen during that recording as well, but when I clicked (anywhere), the robot jumped to the location where it should be.


But I'll ask my groupmate who also works on the same project, we'll see if he has issues with recording.

##### Fabien Rohrer [Moderator] 11/28/2019 16:50:34

##### Fabien Rohrer [Moderator] 11/28/2019 17:44:41
the scope of the "bearing" variable is only in the get\_bearing\_in\_degrees() function. It seems your variable is badly declared.


do you do:


> double bearing = get\_bearing\_in\_degrees();


just before the printf() call?

##### Matt60 11/28/2019 17:45:39
Not at the moment, I will try that

hi everyone,how differential robot mapping the world on webotsÔºü

##### lunarpulse 11/29/2019 08:00:05
Hi everyone, I have simulation environment running on webots and ROS. I have difficulty in recording simulation environment with simulated time (2 minutes). My machine is slow and many ROS nodes slows down the system and simulation to 0.05x and ROSbag records wall time (1 hour) instead of the simulation time 2 minute. Could you help me to record a ros bag in simulated time instead of wall time?

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 11/29/2019 08:00:35
Hi lunarpulse


First, you have to make sure that you did put in the controllerArgs field of your robot the following arguments: '--clock' and '--use-sim-time' (see v for more information)


Then you have to set the 'use\_sim\_time' ROS parameter ([http://wiki.ros.org/Parameter%20Server](http://wiki.ros.org/Parameter%20Server)) to true.


Then both your nodes and bag should use simulation time (or at least record it too).


Hi `@askslk`, I am not sure to understand your question, but if you want to perform SLAM with a differential wheel robot in Webots you might be interested by [https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Cyberbotics%27\_Robot\_Curriculum/Advanced\_Programming\_Exercises#SLAM\_](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Cyberbotics%27_Robot_Curriculum/Advanced_Programming_Exercises#SLAM_)[Advanced]

##### Shadow 11/29/2019 13:30:22
Hi everyone, is there a possible way to create or use existing software to run a webots simulation without the developer environment webots initially provides, effectively to just run the 3d view? Thanks.

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 11/29/2019 13:35:58
Hi  `@Shadow`, yes if you download the webots package: [https://www.cyberbotics.com/download](https://www.cyberbotics.com/download)

You can run all the samples provided withing Webots without coding enything.

If you want to control the motion of your robot/object in Webots from another software, you can create a controller that will act as a bridge between Webots and your other software.

Is that what you would like to do?

##### Shadow 11/29/2019 13:41:42
`@David Mansolino` Thanks for the response, perhaps I can clarify what I'm looking for. I'm currently developing a world with supervisors to detect specific robot actions to gain points. Is there a way that the simulation can be run so that people can develop their own controllers for the robots, but not have the ability to view/edit the world (the node tree etc.) so the simulation is effectively running only the 3d viewing portion rendering the world.

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 11/29/2019 13:47:53
Yes, there are several way to do this:


1. You can set the controller to be 'extern' then the user can write his controller and launch it independently of Webots: [https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/running-extern-robot-controllers](https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/running-extern-robot-controllers)


2. you can run Webots as a web server and user can only program the controller, such as what we did here: [https://robotbenchmark.net/](https://robotbenchmark.net/)

##### UncleDucky 11/29/2019 13:55:11

Hi,  I want to plot a point on the right foot sole of robotis-op2. How can I do it?

##### Yang Chen 12/01/2019 23:09:14
Hi everyone. Recently, I want to compare the speed of a robot in simulation with the same robot in real life. In order to let the robot move forward, in simulation, when I use differnt basic time step  with all other parameters stay the same, the time to finish this same motion is differnt, and the speed by calculating the position of the robot over simulation time  is different too. And I see the user manual about basic time  step set-up. Does that mean I need tune the basic time step according to the real robot's speed, with the same parameters and controller betweem the simulation and real robot?


And when I set a robot arm to move a constant degree(eg. from 10deg to 30deg) by a given simulation time period, what is the kind of motion of the simulation every basic time step? Eg. sometime the simulation can not move the constant degree by a given time. By changing the given time, the simulation could done well. So I am wondering what's the motion style of the simulation, like how many degree the robot move every single basic time step or the robot just move to the goalÔºüAnd how can I find the exact time need to finish moving a constant degree? All are based on the same robot model with same max torque for the rotation motors, same mass of the robot.


Thank you!

##### lunarpulse 12/01/2019 23:36:16

##### Stefania Pedrazzi [cyberbotics] 12/02/2019 07:24:07
> hi, why after add a camera to my robot, the camera cant shot, just a plot of black

`@askslk` did you enable the camera in your robot controller?


`@askslk` there are multiple techniques and algorithm to move a robot to a target point depending on the constraints and devices mounted on the robot (i.e. for example if the robot knows its current position, etc.). You should add more details about your scenario.

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 12/02/2019 07:40:44
Hi  `@chenpixx`, you can use the supervisor API to import/move any node in the scene:

  - [https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/supervisor#wb\_supervisor\_field\_import\_mf\_node](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/supervisor#wb_supervisor_field_import_mf_node)

  - [https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/supervisor#wb\_supervisor\_field\_set\_sf\_vec3f](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/supervisor#wb_supervisor_field_set_sf_vec3f)

This way you can for example simply import a sphere shape and move it to the right foot sole position.

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 12/02/2019 07:46:49
`@YC`L#9474: you should run your simulation in real time mode (using the PLAY button). If the speedometer displays a value significantly lower than 1, that means your simulation is unable to run in real time (at the same speed as the real system). So, only in this case, you should adapt your simulation until it runs in real time. Reducing the `WorldInfo.basicTimeStep` is certainly going to speed-up your simulation, but there are other possibilities such as simplifying the simulation models or the robot controllers.

How to use opencv in webots?

##### Fabien Rohrer [Moderator] 12/03/2019 10:32:07
`@Meisam` Between these 2 releases, we increased the GPU load, mainly because of our migration to PBR, the use of big floating point textures for backgrounds, and postprocessing effects (bloom, global ambient occlusion, etc.). The Webots preferences contain an "OpenGL" tab where you could reduce parameters. You should try to reduce the texture quality, and the ambient occlusion quality. The next release of Webots will use less GPU memory, you could already try the latest nightly builds (develop) to give a try.


`@ega` Please take a look at this example: [https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/samples-howto#vision-wbt](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/samples-howto#vision-wbt) OpenCV is currently released in Webots, you can use it out-of-the-box

      }

It seems the bottleneck is on the CPU then.


This may mean several things...


the bottleneck of your simulation comes from physics and/or your controllers and/or general Webots updates (node update, rendering sort, etc.)


Probably my hypothesis about rendering improvements is wrong then.


Does it has sense in your simulation?

There is an issue with cyberbotics domain website and e-mail. What can we do about it?

##### Fabien Rohrer [Moderator] 12/03/2019 16:29:19
The website is currently down because of issues during a migration on our main server. We are currently working hard to solve this as soon as possible.


You may have access to the documentation inside Webots (Help / Offline documentation)


Some services are currently broken, such as the web resource files.


Do you have other issues?

hi since web is still down, can you tell me if husarion robot [https://husarion.com/](https://husarion.com/) is supported in webot like pioneer mobile base?

##### Yang Chen 12/04/2019 04:11:11
`@Olivier Michel` Thank you for your kind help!

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 12/04/2019 07:31:41
`@jacqueline` husarion robot is not supported out of the box in Webots, but it should be quite straightforward to create a model of this robot. Or to create our URDF importer ([https://github.com/cyberbotics/urdf2webots](https://github.com/cyberbotics/urdf2webots)) to convert the URDF model to Webots: [https://github.com/husarion/rosbot\_description/tree/master/src/rosbot\_description](https://github.com/husarion/rosbot_description/tree/master/src/rosbot_description)

another question, How can I use this code,

const WbCameraRecognitionObject *objects = wb\_camera\_recognition\_get\_objects(camera);



to get all the objects visible to the camera? I want to loop between those objects and see their positions, is there a sample code? üôÇ

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 12/04/2019 11:28:49
You can get the number of object with the 'wb\_camera\_recognition\_get\_number\_of\_objects' function as documented here: [https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots/blob/revision/docs/reference/camera.md#wb\_camera\_has\_recognition](https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots/blob/revision/docs/reference/camera.md#wb_camera_has_recognition)


And here is an example: [https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots/blob/revision/projects/samples/devices/controllers/camera\_recognition/camera\_recognition.c#L59](https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots/blob/revision/projects/samples/devices/controllers/camera_recognition/camera_recognition.c#L59)

##### chamandana 12/04/2019 11:51:51
the camera only detects 2 boxes out of all 30 currently visible in the camera. Some are pretty small. How can I make wb\_camera\_recognition\_get\_objects detect everything in the view? without changing the position or fov of the camera.


Is there a way? üôÇ

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 12/04/2019 11:52:56
You have to make sure that all the objects you want to detect have a recognition color, a model and a boundign object set.


Be also carfull with the 'maxRange' and 'occlusion' fields of the 'Recognition' node.

##### chamandana 12/04/2019 11:54:01

Greetings to all!

My small problem with textures jpeg on Windows and did not manage to be solved. Neither variables PATH, nor installation of different libraries jpeg decoding, has not passed. After investigation has seen that the read error arises in Qt class QImageReader but why he does not see library libjpeg-8.dll delivered in package Webots - I have not understood. Perhaps someone has an access to a code of this class going to release Webots? To clarify what path it searches for library of decoding and why does not find.

##### ClBaze 12/04/2019 16:34:45
Hi guys, what is the time handling strategy of Webots ?

##### Fabien Rohrer [Moderator] 12/04/2019 16:37:52
Hi, the simulation refresh rate is given by WorldInfo.basicTimeStep which increases the simulation time and the physics engine by a constant rate. This time is virtual and is not linked with the true time, therefore a simulation can run faster or slower than true time. Robot controller are generally synchronized on this rate (or an integer multiple of it)


This section gives more info about this: [https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/controller-programming#the-step-and-wb\_robot\_step-functions](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/controller-programming#the-step-and-wb_robot_step-functions)

what does the 0.00x means


the basictimestep is fixed right ?

##### Fabien Rohrer [Moderator] 12/04/2019 16:50:54
Every 0.3 true seconds, the simulation speed is compared with the true time. This second value of the speedometer show the ratio with the true time. If you have 1.0x, you're close to the real time. If you have 2.0x you run twice faster than real time.


Yes, basictimestep is a constant. The same rate for all the simulation.


0.0x means the simulation is stopped.

##### JoHn 12/04/2019 16:57:01

##### Fabien Rohrer [Moderator] 12/04/2019 17:10:29
`@JoHn` don't you think that another object is detected? what is the location of your radar in the truck? (cf. Radar.translation)

##### JoHn 12/04/2019 17:15:08
Hi `@Fabien Rohrer`, thank you for your response. The locationf of the radar can be seen in the screenshot below

Now the white truck is about 8 meters ahead of the grey truck.

##### Fabien Rohrer [Moderator] 12/04/2019 17:21:22
the lidar seems well oriented, the azimuth seems to indicate indeed something front. I cannot explain this 4 meters offset from the screenshot.

##### JoHn 12/04/2019 17:21:40
But the radar shows that the distance is 10 meters and only one object is detected.

##### Fabien Rohrer [Moderator] 12/04/2019 17:22:03
Could you try to simplify your world/controller at best and send it to us? Maybe through a GitHub issue ticket?


[https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots/issues/new/choose](https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots/issues/new/choose)

Now both trucks are very closed. The radar detects one object and the distance is 3.56 meters.


Sure, thank you very much for your answers `@Fabien Rohrer`

##### Fabien Rohrer [Moderator] 12/04/2019 17:24:45
Isn't it the center of the other truck?


What I would do is to create a sphere, and put it at the location indicated by the radar.


Quite archaic, but efficient.


In this case, you will be sure of what the radar detects...


To do so, just put the first truck at the world position 0 (or better, its radar), create a "Transform > Sphere", and move it at the location given by the azimuth+distance.


The center of vehicles is at the center of the 2 rear wheels.


Not very intuitive.

##### JoHn 12/04/2019 17:28:10
Sure, I will try it now.

##### Fabien Rohrer [Moderator] 12/04/2019 17:28:41

##### Stefania Pedrazzi [cyberbotics] 12/05/2019 08:26:32
Yes, a common way is to use the Emitter/Receiver nodes.


Otherwise any method for interprocess communication works also between Webots controllers (i.e. write/read to/from file, shared memory, sockets, etc.)

You should not copy them, but link them from the Makefile:  [https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/using-webots-makefiles](https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/using-webots-makefiles)

Hi

I am using webots ros controller on a custom robots in a multi robot industrial scenario. When two robots face each other, the controller stops sending the velocity commands, but the robots move with the last sent velocity command. So I have written a ros service which sends zero to the robot when velocity controller stops. I have got a strange behaviour that this service works for one robot and it stops but the other one moves with the last cmd.

Anyone have an idea what's could be the problem or a point where I am doing the mistake

`@White` we are currenlty updating our website and not all the features are yet available. However, you shouldn't need and accoutn to use Webots anymore, why do you want to create an account?


`@askslk`, I am really sorry but it is very difficult to understand what is happenning without looking at your simulation.


`@chamandana` there is indeed no argument as the `wb_robot_get_custom_data` function will return the content of the customData field of the robot calling the function, this function is not linked with any device but with the robot directly.


`@seppl2018` Webots is using the port '8873' to communicate with SUMO, it is possible that on your computer this port is not available and therefore Webots can't communicate. You shoudl try to change the port with the correspondign field of the SumoInterface node.


`@Tahir` sorrry no idea where this could come from. Are you sure you are sending these zero to both robots ?

##### Tahir [Moderator] 12/06/2019 08:23:18

Yes

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 12/06/2019 08:26:22

##### JasonChen 12/07/2019 09:00:16
Hi, I am getting the error message of using the function "wb\_motor\_set\_postion" int Matlab, and don't know how to fix it. Can you help me? Thanks.

The Webots version is 2019b-rev1, and Matlab version is 2019b.



Sorry. My fault. The wrong typo.

Hi, I notice there is a view named "support polygon", and I am recently doing simulation on bipedal robot. I wonder through your Webots API, can I get the support polygon information (data)?

##### Fabien Rohrer [Moderator] 12/07/2019 10:59:12
About your issue with matlab, could you show us your controller instead? It seems there is an issue with the arguments. Could you check what is ¬´¬†inf¬†¬ª?


About the support polygon, the supervisor api can retrieve some of these values:

- [https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/supervisor#wb\_supervisor\_node\_get\_static\_balance](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/supervisor#wb_supervisor_node_get_static_balance)


And the contact points:

##### JasonChen 12/07/2019 11:03:47
`@Fabien Rohrer` Thanks, that would be great helpful.


`@Fabien Rohrer` Hi, here is another question. I am now trying to use the wb\_supervisor\_node\_get\_number\_of\_contact\_points function. But it seems that the function in the Matlab has two input parameters? the noderef and index. While in the document, it says it only has one. And the demo code in C also shows it only needs one input parameters. So, what's the second parameter for?

And the demo code in C also shows it only needs one input parameters. So, what's the second parameter for?

##### Fabien Rohrer [Moderator] 12/09/2019 05:15:01
`@Otto` the Proto doc is the best we have: [https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/proto](https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/proto)


The PROTO mechanism is quite simple, it only hide some node hierarchy in a file, with custom fields. It could be extended with a scripting language (lua as a template language). This is extremely powerful, but it requires to be expert in the Webots hierarchy nodes.


`@JasonChen` let me check... normally the matlab API is a direct match of the C API...


Ok I see. This is a bit weird to use...


wb\_supervisor\_node\_get\_contact\_point() is supposed to be called several times.


When an objet collides, it can have several contact polygons.


So this function should be used as follows (in C but in Matlab, it‚Äôs the same logics):


>>> for (int p=0; p < wb\_supervisor\_node\_get\_number\_of\_contact\_points(my\_solid); p++) { // foreach polygon

    const double *polygon\_points = wb\_supervisor\_node\_get\_contact\_point(my\_solid, p); // get the polygon coordinates

  printf(¬´¬†polygon %d\n¬†¬ª,  p);

  int c = 0;

  while (true) {

     if (isnan(polygon\_points[3 * c])

      break; // no more points for this polygon 

    printf(¬´ point %f %f %f\n¬†¬ª,

      polygon\_points[3 * c],

      polygon\_points[3 * c + 1],

      polygon\_points[3 * c + 2]

    );

    c++;

  }

}


So the second parameter of wb\_supervisor\_node\_get\_contact\_point() is the polygon index. This function should be called several times until it returns NaN to get the polygon coordinates.

##### JasonChen 12/09/2019 05:39:47
no, no, no


I mean the wb\_supervisor\_node\_get\_number\_of\_contact\_points(my\_solid) has another parameter in matlab


you see, you have only one parameter here.


`@Fabien Rohrer`


can you please have a check

##### Fabien Rohrer [Moderator] 12/09/2019 05:42:28
noderef and index?

##### JasonChen 12/09/2019 05:42:33
yes


which is weird for the function "wb\_supervisor\_node\_get\_number\_of\_contact\_points(my\_solid)"

##### Fabien Rohrer [Moderator] 12/09/2019 05:44:01
Oh, I get the point, now. Sorry it seems indeed there is a mistake


Let me check.

##### JasonChen 12/09/2019 05:44:28
ok, thanks.

##### Fabien Rohrer [Moderator] 12/09/2019 05:48:37
Yes, this is definitely wrong I will open an issue ticket so that you could monitor the issue resolution, and will do my best to fix this on this morning.

##### Fabien Rohrer [Moderator] 12/09/2019 06:52:56
`@Nocturnal Warfare` Webots is compatible with any IDE, it‚Äôs a matter to set it up correctly.


You could refer to this document to have general guidelines to setup your IDE: [https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/using-your-ide](https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/using-your-ide)


`@JasonChen` Just to notify you that the bug has been fixed by `@Stefania Pedrazzi` in the develop version of Webots, and will be a part of the next release (before the end of this year), and of the next "develop" nightly build (tomorrow): [https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots/pull/1157](https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots/pull/1157)

Hi there, i can't seem to import any file types other than VRML97. I've read it's a very old format. Is this the best we can do?

##### Stefania Pedrazzi [cyberbotics] 12/09/2019 12:17:32
Hi `@Hayden Woodger`, yes to import your model or project (if not already developed with Webots) in Webots you have to export to VRML. The reason is that Webots format is an extension of VRML. But if you are using Blender, we provide a tool to export your Blender project directly to Webots format: [https://github.com/cyberbotics/blender-webots-exporter](https://github.com/cyberbotics/blender-webots-exporter)

##### Hayden Woodger 12/09/2019 12:19:49
Thank you! I will use blender in future with this add-on. 

After you've exported to VRML from blender, will the model in Webots be accurate in dimensions?

##### Stefania Pedrazzi [cyberbotics] 12/09/2019 12:22:56
Yes, you just have to make sure that the model is exported in meters.

##### Hayden Woodger 12/09/2019 12:23:33

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 12/09/2019 14:52:18
OK, then it's not a problem with the name, but rather with the behavior of the sensor.

##### Stefania Pedrazzi [cyberbotics] 12/09/2019 14:52:24
`wb_distance_sensor_get_value` returns a double not an int => you should use `%f` in your printf

##### chamandana 12/09/2019 14:52:38
it returns 0.000 once %f is used

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 12/09/2019 14:53:01
That may be normal. Is there any obstacle in front of the sensor?

##### chamandana 12/09/2019 14:53:07
it says they expected an int


`@Olivier Michel` here it shows fine

but I can't get it via code

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 12/09/2019 14:55:33
The warning you get looks wrong as `wb_distance_sensor_get_value` for sure returns a double value. See [https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/distancesensor#distancesensor-functions](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/distancesensor#distancesensor-functions)

##### chamandana 12/09/2019 14:56:01
I get another error warning: implicit declaration of function 'wb\_distance\_sensor\_enable'; did you mean 'wb\_range\_finder\_enable'? [-Wimplicit-function-declaration]

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 12/09/2019 14:56:01
So, there may be something wrong in your code. Did you include properly `<webots/distance_sensor.h>`?

##### chamandana 12/09/2019 14:56:39
yeah

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 12/09/2019 14:57:04
So, I don't understand why you get these warnings...


You shouldn't.


And that's probably the cause of your problem, not being able to retrieve distance sensor values.

##### chamandana 12/09/2019 14:57:55
what if I try remove #include range\_finder.h

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 12/09/2019 14:58:30
Can you try ? I would be surprised however if that helps.

##### chamandana 12/09/2019 14:58:59
yeah. üòÑ it didn't help

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 12/09/2019 14:59:34
Otherwise, I would recommend you to try to run `webots/projects/samples/devices/worlds/distance_sensor.wbt` and edit the associated robot controller which works retrieving distance sensor values. Then, compare it with yours.

##### chamandana 12/09/2019 15:00:12

yes I believe that is what I am doing but it is linking libopencv\_core.so.2.4 instead of libopencv\_core.so.3.2


Is there a way to override opencv2.4 used by webots?

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 12/09/2019 16:23:25
Worse case you can remove it from the 'lib' folder (this will not prevent Webots from working as it is not used directly by Webots)

Hey everyone !


I have a little problem with webots, I have a little problem with Webots. When I instanciate a new proto thanks to the supervisor, and that this proto is "locked" by default to another connector, I run into "unexpected behaviors". It kind of "explode" ?


Here is a video of the instanciation with the lock :


[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZP6e8Upyqhk&feature=youtu.be](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZP6e8Upyqhk&feature=youtu.be)

`@Gautier A.` Hi Gautier

##### nap 12/10/2019 09:03:15
Hi everyone

I have a project from Webots 7 that I'm migrating into Webots 2019b r1.

I have a number of 'Solid' objects which have a texture applied to them, but the rendered texture appears 'washed out' compared to the original texture.  Any tips on how to fix this please?

##### Fabien Rohrer [Moderator] 12/10/2019 09:04:20
`@Gautier A.` Could it be that the Connector are badly oriented? Normally, it's z-axis forwards, y-axis upwards.


`@Gautier A.` I'm contacting you with a private message, we have things to discuss üòâ


`@nap` Good choice üòâ


`@nap` Between Webots 7 and R2019b, we changed our rendering engine and introduced PBR, HDR backgrounds etc.


You should change the following in your .wbt and .protos files:


1. Remove the Background node and replace it by a TexturedBackground instance.


2. Replace every Appearance node by the PBRAppearance node, and update their fields: [https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/pbrappearance](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/pbrappearance)


3. An iteration on the light fields is also often required.


For the textures in particular, you should use this PBRAppearance template:


>>> PBRAppearance {

  roughness 1

  metalness 0

  baseColorMap ImageTexture {

    url "path/to/your/texture.jpg"

  }

}


Let us know if you encounter issues during your migration üôÇ

##### nap 12/10/2019 09:15:01
`@Fabien Rohrer` : Thanks!!  I'll do that now and see how I go.


I'm only using a .wbt for this, and in its XML, I have the following the solid I'm going to fix first:

Solid {

  translation 0 0.025 0.82

  children [

    DEF Static\_Obstacle Shape {

      appearance Appearance {

        texture ImageTexture {

          url [

            "textures/do\_not\_enter.png"

          ]

        }

      }

      geometry Box {

        size 0.05 0.05 0.05

      }

    }

  ]

  name "fixed01"

  boundingObject USE Static\_Obstacle

}


So, no TexturedBackground.  But let me go through the rest and see if it works.

##### Fabien Rohrer [Moderator] 12/10/2019 09:19:46
Ok, it seems that the only problematic point is the Appearance node then, if you follow the instructions above, the migration would work smoothly.


About the TexturedBackground node, I recommend you to add one, it would increase A LOT the rendering quality of your simulation.

##### nap 12/10/2019 09:21:30
`@Fabien Rohrer` : Ok, I'll do that.

Another question:  Is there a search function in the Off-line User Manual?

##### Fabien Rohrer [Moderator] 12/10/2019 09:22:09
Unfortunately no.


To be honest, googling our doc is very powerful, we are well referenced: "webots lidar", "webots using python", etc.

##### nap 12/10/2019 09:24:43
True, but then I have the latency accessing the web.

##### Fabien Rohrer [Moderator] 12/10/2019 09:25:31
I understand this, this is an interesting missing feature, I will keep it in mind.

##### Stefania Pedrazzi [cyberbotics] 12/10/2019 09:27:50
`@nap` if you clone the Webots github repository you should be able to run the documention on your browser offline


I'm not sure that this works with the released Webots package too


yes, it works from the Webots package too, I just checked


you should simply start a python HTTP server:

1. go to the `<WEBOTS>/docs` folder

2. start the python HTTP server: `python -m SimpleHTTPServer`

3. then from your browser open `localhost:8000` and you should get the documentation


for the reference manual the URL is `http://localhost:8000/?book=reference&page=index`

##### Dorteel 12/10/2019 09:36:42
Thank you `@Fabien Rohrer` , unfortunately I don't know much about modifying the PATH, it's a desktop from the university that we got the error on, it works perfectly on my own computer.

It seems your environement tries to run another Python:


>>> /home/robotlab/r762/bin/ROB762/bin/python3

##### Dorteel 12/10/2019 10:02:12
but I thought if I define this python for WeBots on the shebang line, then that's what WeBots will use

##### Fabien Rohrer [Moderator] 12/10/2019 10:04:35
it's the case. Webots uses first the shebang, and then the "Webots Preferences / General / Python command" preference to locate the Python binary.


How did you installed Webots? From snap? Which version? What is your OS?

##### Dorteel 12/10/2019 10:06:27
Distributor ID:    Ubuntu

Description:    Ubuntu 16.04.6 LTS

Release:    16.04

Codename:    xenial


installed through the Ubuntu software store


R2019b revision 1

##### Gautier A. 12/10/2019 10:10:40
`@Fabien Rohrer`  I think the axis are "correct". I delted the shape of the connector and just have the "connector" in the Tree object to show only its coordinate system
%figure
![test_supervisor_tile_container_2.png](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/565154703139405824/653901392230088714/test_supervisor_tile_container_2.png)
%end


Also, its not really visible but it's a supervisor that instanciate the tiles and, after instanciating them, move them to the correct coordiante and orientation. The "connectors" works when it's placed and locked manually before the simulation begins, but the "problem" is when we use the supervisor to instanciate the proto of the object with the connector.

##### Fabien Rohrer [Moderator] 12/10/2019 10:16:52
`@Dorteel` Ok, I think I see the issue. When is installing from the Ubuntu store (aka snap), it runs with restricted privileges, this may cause issues to detect external Python binaries. You could either uninstall Webots and reinstall it from the tar.bz2 package (cf. [https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots/releases](https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots/releases)) or use external controllers mechanism which should prevent this limitation (cf. [https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/running-extern-robot-controllers](https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/running-extern-robot-controllers))

##### Dorteel 12/10/2019 10:19:13
Thank you very much `@Fabien Rohrer` for your help and patience, we'll try that!

##### Stefania Pedrazzi [cyberbotics] 12/10/2019 10:19:16
here are some specific instructions for the snap package in case: [https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/installation-procedure?version=develop&tab-os=windows#installing-the-snap-package](https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/installation-procedure?version=develop&tab-os=windows#installing-the-snap-package)

##### nap 12/10/2019 10:19:33
`@Fabien Rohrer` : Thanks for the help on converting.  My texture issue is resolved to my satisfaction.  (There are more settings in the PBR than I want to mess with right now.)  I also did the same for the floor and walls. (Though I need to work out the exact mapping of the walls because my Uni Logo isn't showing in the right place.)

##### Fabien Rohrer [Moderator] 12/10/2019 10:21:23
`@nap` thank you for the feedback, I also advise you to use our PROTO to manage floors and walls, typically the RectangleArena PROTO: [https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/object-floors#rectanglearena](https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/object-floors#rectanglearena) It is simple to set, and more robust on long term.


`@Gautier A.` Ok, the axis seems indeed to be correct. So the next step is to dig into the Connector fields.


`@Gautier A.` About the supervisor instantiation, why not directly set the translation/rotation when calling the import function? It seems simpler and more robust. (Do you understand what I'm speaking about?)

##### nap 12/10/2019 10:25:13
`@Fabien Rohrer` : Yes, I'm using a RectangleArena (and its default proto) with FloorAppearance and WallAppearance stanzas that have the PBR code.


`@Stefania Pedrazzi` :  I've cloned the repo, run the simple http server and browsed the url you gave.  However, I'm not getting anything useful.  It appears to me that I need to build the documentation using something like Doxygen, first?

##### Stefania Pedrazzi [cyberbotics] 12/10/2019 10:29:38
`@nap` if you run the simple http server from a Webots installation folder (installed from any package) it should work out of the box. From the Git repo you first need to run `python local_exporter.py` in the `<WEBOTS>/docs` folder

##### nap 12/10/2019 10:47:11
`@Fabien Rohrer` : For a search function, you may wish to look at how Doxygen does it when it builds a html based site.

##### Fabien Rohrer [Moderator] 12/10/2019 10:50:46
`@nap` thank you for the advise. The Webots documentation is a "hand-made" system, based on GitHub and Markdown. Inspiring a search system on the Doxygen one is definitively a good idea.

##### Gautier A. 12/10/2019 12:16:44
`@Fabien Rohrer`  Thank you a lot ! It works now ! It was indeed a problem because the object was instanciated through the supervisor at the "orign point", which might have posed problems with ODE

##### Hayden Woodger 12/10/2019 12:45:46
`@Fabien Rohrer` Thanks, i've just seen your reply. Much appreciated.

##### Uncle Ducky 12/10/2019 14:14:48

##### Fabien Rohrer [Moderator] 12/10/2019 14:16:16
Just select the Camera node in the scene tree, a rotational gizmo should appear in the 3D view. You could rotate the camera using this gizmo.


minus z-axis is the direction of the camera, the y-axis should point to the top.

I wondered why webots crashing after few seconds of simulation execution. It was actually reaching 100% memory usage


I know it should be my fault, but is there in Webots or the API that can be used to collect garbage

##### Uncle Ducky 12/10/2019 16:21:32
Does anyone know a sample world where a robot will move towards a specified object once it has been recognised?

##### Fabien Rohrer [Moderator] 12/10/2019 16:24:55
`@chamandana` It's more a programming issue than Webots issue. No Webots is not providing such tool, but your programming language does. You should debug it.

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 12/10/2019 16:25:30
Hi `@Uncle Ducky` Webots doesn't provide such example, however you might either use Radar ([https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/radar?tab-language=c](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/radar?tab-language=c)) or smart camera ([https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/camera?tab-language=c#wb\_camera\_recognition\_get\_objects](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/camera?tab-language=c#wb_camera_recognition_get_objects)) to detect position of objects relative to the robot and them move toward it.

`@Fabien Rohrer` hey, I'm using I/O (a file) to simulate data transfer between two controllers. Might that be the reason of excessive RAM usage


shouldn't it only be HDD usage?

##### Fabien Rohrer [Moderator] 12/10/2019 18:36:13
Difficult to tell without looking at your code.. why not using the Emitter and Receiver nodes to communicate between your controllers?

##### chamandana 12/10/2019 18:37:10
Ok i'm gonna try to implement emmitter receiver again. thanks


hey, how does the moving of kuka youbot's gripper work? It moves even after I set the arm\_ik(x,y,z)


as I've asked before when using the receiver it always says invalid device tag


üò¶

##### Fabien Rohrer [Moderator] 12/10/2019 20:08:31
About the arm, you should inspire yourself from the youbot demo controller.


About the invalid device tag, this generally occurs when the device name does not match between the model and the controller.

yeah. It's above the step loop so It gets initialized first thing


ooh, I just found out that the RAM usage is same as before (with and without using file I/O for Inter-process Communication). So, I could still use the file method. üôÇ but I should optimize it I think. I'm still learning C, don't know much about garbage collection.

Hi, I have a small problem trying to compile my controller in a terminal using MacOS (Mojave).  I've exported the WEBOTS\_HOME variable, and when I run 'make', I get the following:

'/Applications/Webots/resources/Makefile.os.include:86: *** The Mac OS X SDK is not found. Please check that XCode and its command line tools are correctly installed..  Stop.'



Now, I definitely have Xcode installed and it's command line tools as I use them for other projects I'm doing at Uni.

Anyone know how to resolve this?


Running "xcode-select -p" gives "/Applications/Xcode10-2.app/Contents/Developer"


Since I have two versions of Xcode installed, my Xcodes are called 10-1.app (v10.1) and 10-2.app (v10.2)

looks like I need to fiddle Makefile.os.include in my situation.


hmmm, I'm now getting an odd error:

`@Stefania Pedrazzi` : Hi Stefania, thanks for the local documentation tip yesterday.  However, the command you showed me only generated the Reference Manual.  Is there a command to generate the User Guide?

##### Stefania Pedrazzi [cyberbotics] 12/11/2019 07:23:22
`@nap` you just have to change the URL

* http://localhost:8000/?book=reference&page=index for the Reference Manual

* http://localhost:8000/?book=guide&page=index for the User Guide


Here is the complete documentation: [https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots/blob/master/docs/README.md#run-the-doc-locally](https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots/blob/master/docs/README.md#run-the-doc-locally)

##### Fabien Rohrer [Moderator] 12/11/2019 07:35:47
`@nap` About your issues with the macOS SDK...


Webots is looking for the SDK with this command:


> xcrun --sdk macosx --show-sdk-path


Could you try to run it in a terminal?


About the command line tools, sometimes after an XCode update, it is required to just launch XCode to update them. Could you try this?


You can also trigger manually the command line tool update by typing the following line in the terminal:


> xcode-select --install

##### nap 12/11/2019 07:52:47
`@Fabien Rohrer` :

xcrun => /Applications/Xcode10-2.app/Contents/Developer/Platforms/MacOSX.platform/Developer/SDKs/MacOSX10.14.sdk



I use Xcode all the time here, so it is setup and working.

##### Fabien Rohrer [Moderator] 12/11/2019 07:54:12
Yes, I'm sure of this is setup correctly.


What version of Webots do you use?

It's the exact  same `xcrun`  command I asked you to run.


So it means that Webots runs in an environment where xcrun cannot be executed smoothly.

##### nap 12/11/2019 07:59:32

You should rather replace them like this:

`@chamandana` Hi


Good news first, I found the issue with your receiver üôÇ

##### chamandana 12/11/2019 09:00:14
what is it? üòã

##### Fabien Rohrer [Moderator] 12/11/2019 09:02:12
It is required to call wb\_receiver\_get\_queue\_length() before wb\_receiver\_get\_data(), but the warning in case this is not fulfilled is cryptic: invalid device tag.


So you should modify your controller like this:


> while (wb\_receiver\_get\_queue\_length(receiver) > 0) {

>     const char *buffer = wb\_receiver\_get\_data(receiver);

>     // Do something with the buffer.

>   }


This is a cryptic message from our API, I will solve this in the next release:

This may cause the memory leak too. But I would recommend you to switch to Webots R2020a as soon as we release, because we improved the memory usage of Webots (the "develop" nightly builds are already solving this).

`@Fabien Rohrer` : lol, it's still giving the same error after I replaced the assignment with  a static path.

There is something wrong in line 76::   ifeq ($(wildcard $(MACOSX\_SDK\_PATH)),)

The  MACOSX\_SDK\_PATH variable has the correct path (including the extension).



I've had a quick check to see what 'wildcard' does, but haven't found anything yet.  So I have no idea what its purpose is,


`@Fabien Rohrer` : BTW, I like the way the 'pinned' messages have been utilised.  Good feedback.

##### Fabien Rohrer [Moderator] 12/11/2019 09:45:54
`@nap` The wildcard is simply a way to check that the file exists in the Makefile syntax.

##### nap 12/11/2019 09:46:46
Oh, but the way the line is coded, it's being interpreted as a bash command.


But I have another question at the moment, because it seems I can build inside Webots itself.  So, whilst I really need to be able to build from the terminal later, I am trying to get my old E-Puck Controller going first.

##### Fabien Rohrer [Moderator] 12/11/2019 09:48:39
yes, the `xcrun` is executed by bash, it returns a path, and it's existence is checked by the wildcard Makefile function. This should work, you're the first user who is annoyed by this line.


Ok, please ask your questions üòâ

##### nap 12/11/2019 09:52:06
There is a error in 76.  The "$(" in front of the *wildcard* command, and its trailing parenthesis, need to be removed.

(My Q)

In W7 (using C++), I was able to include:

  #include <webots/Robot.hpp>

  #include <webots/DifferentialWheels.hpp>

in my controller and then be able to use the various sensors.

Now I'm getting an error:

  *epuckMeanderLinesByGSM\_Behaviour.cpp:121:14: error: member access into incomplete type 'webots::DistanceSensor'*

So it seems that I need to change which headers I include.

I'm wondering if this information can be found anywhere?  Something that summarises how things have changed?


`@Fabien Rohrer` :  lol.  With them removed, I've moved on to another error in the Makefile, but this is not something like the above.

##### Fabien Rohrer [Moderator] 12/11/2019 09:56:49
Are you sure that "#include <webots/DifferentialWheels.hpp>" is included in "epuckMeanderLinesByGSM\_Behaviour.cpp"? This is a typical build error occuring when the class definition is not found.


MACOSX\_SDK\_PATH should be defined correctly, otherwise it is for sure not working later...

##### nap 12/11/2019 10:02:41
`@Fabien Rohrer` : Now it's working with the original code, using xcrun to retrieve the path.  That is really strange!!


Yes, both of those includes are in the cpp file.


`@Fabien Rohrer` : Yes, both includes are in the cpp file.


`@Fabien Rohrer` : As a reference, the code is in my repository on github @ [https://github.com/Napoleon-BlownApart/IdempotentPlanningProtocol/tree/master/webots/controllers/epuckMeanderLinesByGSM](https://github.com/Napoleon-BlownApart/IdempotentPlanningProtocol/tree/master/webots/controllers/epuckMeanderLinesByGSM)


`@Fabien Rohrer` : Ok, I added: #include "<webots/DistanceSensor.hpp>", and it's built.  So I'm wondering if there is some sort of migration guide as I have other more complicated projects.

Normally we have a very good backward compatibility, but for sure, time to time, we need to break things.


DifferentialWheel node has been dropped.

The e-puck proto model contains already this modification, but you need to modify your controller accordingly.

`@Fabien Rohrer` : Ok, I've found the DifferentialWheels material in the documentation.  Thanks.  I'll fix up my controller, and then I'll come back to the CLI building problem.

##### Fabien Rohrer [Moderator] 12/11/2019 10:33:46
That sounds good, good luck with this üëçüèª

##### nap 12/11/2019 10:37:58
Would you know of any sample C++ code for an e-puck?  All the examples in Webots seem to be either in C or use bsg files.

##### Fabien Rohrer [Moderator] 12/11/2019 10:39:12
Not in my knowledge, the reason is that the e-puck is very related to C (originally at least), because to be able to cross-compile code on it.

##### nap 12/11/2019 10:40:04
Ic.  I did notice a number of items relating to cross-compiling.


But, I might be lucky...  I found some 'botstudio' thing for the e-puck.  It's in C++.  Could you shed some light on what this does?  Its located at:

/Applications/Webots.app/projects/robots/gctronic/e-puck/plugins/robot\_windows/botstudio/e-puck

##### Fabien Rohrer [Moderator] 12/11/2019 10:43:52
This is a complex robot window, moreover it's deprecated. This is not a good example for you üò¶


You should rather take a look at other differential wheels robots, typically this example:


[https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots/blob/revision/projects/languages/cpp/worlds/example.wbt](https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots/blob/revision/projects/languages/cpp/worlds/example.wbt)

##### nap 12/11/2019 10:54:34
My world .wbt file includes a reference to an e-puck proto as follows:



E-puck {

  translation -0.165 0 0.83

  controller "epuckwhiteboard"

  groundSensorsSlot [

    E-puckGroundSensors {

    }

  ]

}



Are you saying I should not use the e-puck in this way?


And that instead I should define the PROTO structure using the above example? (Which looks to me to have 3 (or 4 if you robots if you count the supervisor).

##### Fabien Rohrer [Moderator] 12/11/2019 11:02:46
This is the good way to include the e-puck.

##### chamandana 12/11/2019 11:04:38
`@Fabien Rohrer` so, I've downloaded Webots 2020a, but the RAM usage is still going up

`@chamandana` I just run some test on projects/samples/devices/worlds/emitter\_receiver.wbt. When running the example in real time, there is indeed a small memory leak of about 100k every 4 seconds. Could you confirm you have similar results?


but it stabilized after a while...


Is it worst in your simulation?

##### nap 12/11/2019 11:14:24
`@Fabien Rohrer` : What about the graphic representation?

##### Fabien Rohrer [Moderator] 12/11/2019 11:15:03
`@nap` Sorry, but I don't understnad. Could you clarify your question?

##### chamandana 12/11/2019 11:15:44
`@Fabien Rohrer` In the above example (original version) i've sent there is no code running. It's just the world. Can you examine it and tell me what might be wrong please. thanks

##### nap 12/11/2019 11:16:22
And what do I select from within Webots when I use the "Add New -> PROTO nodes (Webots Projects)"?


Sorry, I want to be able to see an e-puck robot in my simulation, without needing to create my own skins, etc.

##### Fabien Rohrer [Moderator] 12/11/2019 11:17:58
`@nap` This seems correct, just select the E-puck.proto from the "Add new node" dialog (as you suggest).

##### nap 12/11/2019 11:18:27
`@Fabien Rohrer` : Ok, that's what I've done.


and that's what's generated the above XML that is in my .wbt file.

##### Fabien Rohrer [Moderator] 12/11/2019 11:22:03
`@chamandana`  I can indeed reproduce a huge memory request at the begining of your simulation, in Webots. ~100Mo per second. But it stabilized after a while at 3.0Go (which is big).


I will take a closer look at this.


`@nap` This seems to be correct: what disturbs you?

##### chamandana 12/11/2019 11:37:38
`@Fabien Rohrer` okay üôÇ

##### nap 12/11/2019 11:48:40
`@Fabien Rohrer` : I'm having a little difficulty understanding how to transition from DifferentialWheels to the other classes;  two HingeJoint, RotationalMotor and PositionSensor nodes, but whilst still using the GCTronic e-puck.


My code builds, but nothing happens in the simulator, and once I enabled the LED and LightSensors on the robot, the controller crashes. üò¶

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 12/11/2019 11:56:17
`@nap`, you should probably start from one of the controller provided within Webots and then change it step by step to integrate your controller inside.

##### nap 12/11/2019 11:58:55
`@David Mansolino` : unfortunately they are all in C, but I'll take that approach as I recognised the naming convention.  I just need to work out the class hierarchy.

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 12/11/2019 12:00:45
In that cass, I strongly recommend to check this tutorial: [https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/tutorial-4-more-about-controllers](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/tutorial-4-more-about-controllers)

This tutorial shows how to control the e-puck robot in any language.

##### juanrh 12/11/2019 13:27:47
Hi, I'm trying to launch the python example [https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots/tree/revision/projects/languages/python](https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots/tree/revision/projects/languages/python) but the keyboard is ignored. I added `print("{} - Detected key [{}]".format(datetime.now(), k))` to see which key is detected, and it prints `-1` all the time, even when no key is pressed


I'm on Fedora 30 installed through snap. Any idea what is wrong here?

##### Fabien Rohrer [Moderator] 12/11/2019 13:29:05
Hi, do you select the robot in the 3D window before trying to use the keyboard?

##### juanrh 12/11/2019 13:29:38
no, let me try that


yeah, it was that


thanks a lot Fabien!

##### Fabien Rohrer [Moderator] 12/11/2019 13:31:37
you're welcome üòâ


the 3d window should be selected to deal with the keyboard events. In this case the keyboard events are sent to every controllers. If only one robot is selected, then the keyboard events are only sent to the selected robot.

##### nap 12/11/2019 14:04:13
`@Fabien Rohrer` : The old Webots 'run()' method is gone now, and the main() method is used directly instead of a sub-class.  So the controller is a standalone executable that links to webots.

Is this a correct interpretation?

##### Fabien Rohrer [Moderator] 12/11/2019 14:35:56
Mmmm. The controller is indeed a standalone executable linked with a shared library (libController) dialoging with Webots. So the main() method is used directly. But it has been always the case, and Webots never had a `run()` method.

##### nap 12/11/2019 14:37:26
Cheers.  All our controllers have used a run() method, but I just followed what some others had done.

##### Fabien Rohrer [Moderator] 12/11/2019 14:38:03
I cannot explain this, it's not related with Webots.


I don't know how your controllers were working before. But a main() was always required.

##### aysegulucar 12/11/2019 14:59:02
Hi, when my controller transferring  to real robotis-op2 , I received the error "Unable to establish connection with the robot.

`@chamandana` I found and fix the memory leak issue that I can reproduce from your simulation: [https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots/pull/1181](https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots/pull/1181)

##### Fabien Rohrer [Moderator] 12/11/2019 15:14:29
Ok, great.


Let me check, we have documentation for this...


This page, and in particular this section explains this in details: [https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/controller-programming#the-step-and-wb\_robot\_step-functions](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/controller-programming#the-step-and-wb_robot_step-functions)

##### Mope 12/11/2019 15:17:03
Thank you, I am reading through it now.

##### Fabien Rohrer [Moderator] 12/11/2019 15:17:56
But very basically, when you call the wb\_robot\_step(period), the controller is blocked for the "period" time. The commands are sent to Webots. Then one or several physics steps can be executed in the meantime, for a "period" duration. And finally the sensor feedback is sent to the controller just before continuing its execution.


All of this is in "simulated time", it's the virtual time of the simulation (which can be slower or quicker than the real true time).

##### Mope 12/11/2019 15:20:06
Awesome, appreciate the help! I'm gonna try and get it working now!

   wb\_gps\_get\_values(gps);

but it doesnt seem to wokr

##### Fabien Rohrer [Moderator] 12/11/2019 15:45:59
`@webot123` indeed, it seems far to work üòâ your if condition is triggered when the absolute x-axis of the position is below minus one meter. I don't know what you would like to do with this..

##### webot123 12/11/2019 15:46:55

##### Fabien Rohrer [Moderator] 12/11/2019 15:49:45
this means that `gps_value` is not declared. It's a C programming issue.

##### webot123 12/11/2019 15:50:24
ok, thanks... what line of code do you recommend to declare that?

##### Fabien Rohrer [Moderator] 12/11/2019 15:53:39
typically: "const double *gps\_value = wb\_gps\_get\_values(my\_well\_declared\_gps);" just above your line.

Webots uses two different time steps:



The simulation step (specified in the Scene Tree: WorldInfo.basicTimeStep). It actually is the time which calculates the simulation step. i.e. physics if used. means it adavqances the simulation. On the other hand the control step (specified as an argument of the wb\_robot\_step function for each robot) is the time which controls the control loop it take cares of sensors and actuators

##### nap 12/12/2019 05:54:14
I'm having a little difficulty getting the E-Puck camera to work when using a C++ based controller.

I have included the library and defined a pointer as "Camera* myCam"

Later, when I initialise it using:

myCam = this->getCamera("Camera");

(Where 'this' is a subclass of Robot)


I get an error "Warning: "Camera" device not found."


If I try to enable the cam using "myCam->enable(2 * TIME\_STEP);

my controller crashes.


The documentation about the E-Puck gives extensive details about how the camera works and what methods are available for use.  However, there is no code that shows how to actually use it.

Can anyone suggest a link to the right place in the documentation?


Please, and thanks.

##### Nocturnal Warfare 12/12/2019 06:02:15
I am trying to go through the tutorials and I'm running into an issue with running my custom controller for the epuck, this is the error the console pops out:

```INFO: e-puck_go_forward: Starting controller: python.exe -u "e-puck_go_forward.py"

Any ideas as to what is causing "ValueError: source code string cannot contain null bytes"

##### nap 12/12/2019 06:04:41
What are lines 3 and 15?


are you sure there should be an underscore in front of \_controller?

##### Nocturnal Warfare 12/12/2019 06:07:23
line 3 is just the import in the controller:

`from controller import Robot, Motor, Camera`

line 15 is from the Python API files, so line 15 of the controller.py imports \_controller:

```# Import the low-level C/C++ module
if __package__ or "." in __name__:
    from . import _controller
else:
    import \_controller
```


im guessing that the \_controller is the C controller module

##### nap 12/12/2019 06:10:29
Yes, doing C bindings.  I don't program much in Python, but from the 'null bytes' message, maybe the C controller isn't being found?  Have you set the necessary environment variables?

##### Nocturnal Warfare 12/12/2019 06:11:09
no, what environment variables do i have to set?

##### nap 12/12/2019 06:13:59

Help --> Webots Guided Tour --> Devices Tour --> camera.wbt

##### nap 12/12/2019 06:33:28
Thanks.  I had a look, but it's not an E-Puck (whose PROTO is very different).

The Robot in that example has a Camera Node, but the E-Puck doesn't (but I'm going to check the default proto to see if it is there).

##### Nocturnal Warfare 12/12/2019 06:36:23
so im messing around with the motors now, when you make a robot object, and then try to get robot.getMotor('left motor') or whatever the name of the motor is on the robot, it doesnt seem to return as a motor object, at least visual studio code and pycharm are recognizing it as a motor. on the other hand, both of those editors recognize robot properly and have code filling for its respective functions, do you have any idea why that is? should i make a motor object on its own in the code?

##### nap 12/12/2019 06:36:41
Yes it does have a cam defined in its proto:  DEF EPUCK\_CAMERA Camera


try "left wheel motor"  and "right wheel motor"


and for the encoders, if you're using them, use "left wheel sensor", "right wheel sensor"

##### Nocturnal Warfare 12/12/2019 06:39:01
no i can manipulate the functions associated with them, just the code does not autofill when i put a '.' for instance, where when i do the same with the robot, it does


hey it works, like if i just do 
```leftMotor = Motor('left wheel motor')
rightMotor = Motor('right wheel motor')` instead of `#leftMotor = robot.getMotor('left wheel motor')
\#rightMotor = robot.getMotor('right wheel motor')
``` it works fine


have you had any luck setting up an external controller through something other than the built in editor like Visual Studio Code?

##### nap 12/12/2019 06:52:30
Success here too.  Needed "camera" instead of "Camera".  lol

##### Nocturnal Warfare 12/12/2019 06:52:39
nice

##### nap 12/12/2019 06:53:28
I'm currently using the built in editor because the the build fails from the command line.


I'm migrating my project from Webots7 to the current OS one.


Since there have been some substantial API changes, I decided that I would get my controller working first, then worry about CLI building.


In linux I use CodeBlocks for the controllers and was able to build directly from the C::B IDE.  On MacOS, which I'm on right now, unfortunately there is no working C::B available, so I normally use Xcode (which I hate).


I haven't used Windows for any coding in a while.

##### Nocturnal Warfare 12/12/2019 06:57:22
yeah im currently on windows, trying to mess with the environment variables in order to make VS code see the necessary modules

##### nap 12/12/2019 06:57:48
Yes, that aspect is much easier to manage in Linux/Macos.

do i have to uninstall 2019b first?

##### Stefania Pedrazzi [cyberbotics] 12/12/2019 07:20:16
Yes, but the Windows installer should do it automatically.

##### Nocturnal Warfare 12/12/2019 07:21:54

`@Stefania Pedrazzi` hello.

##### Stefania Pedrazzi [cyberbotics] 12/12/2019 07:27:37
`@Nocturnal Warfare` what do you mean exactly?


`@nap` Hi

##### Nocturnal Warfare 12/12/2019 07:30:08
like to get my controller to run externally i have to create PYTHONPATH variables that tell the program to look in a certain directory shown below:

`PYTHONPATH = C:\Program Files\Webots\lib\controller\python37; C:\Program Files\Webots\msys64\mingw64\bin; C:\Program Files\Webots\lib\python37;`

But I was wondering if there is a more generic way to do that if I want to run this code on multiple computers where that path isnt necessarily valid, so I was wondering if there is any way to get the Webots Directory dynamically versus having it hard coded


BTW its still not finding the \_controller file, failing with the same error

##### Stefania Pedrazzi [cyberbotics] 12/12/2019 07:35:14
The controller need the Webots libraries to run so you should link to them on all the machines. You can set other environmental variables on your system to make it more generic (for example using a variable fot the Webots installation directory) but other than this I don't see any other things that could not be hard coded

##### Nocturnal Warfare 12/12/2019 07:35:41
ok i figured as much thank you anyway


`C:\Program Files\Webots\lib\python37` The first has both controller.py, vehicle.py and \_controller.pyd, vehicle.pyd while the latter only has the \_controller.py and vehicle.py

##### Stefania Pedrazzi [cyberbotics] 12/12/2019 07:41:41
Ok, thank you. I will check but this seems an error of the installer

##### Nocturnal Warfare 12/12/2019 07:41:55
should all 6 be in both locations?


or just in the lib\controller\python37?

##### Stefania Pedrazzi [cyberbotics] 12/12/2019 07:42:11
the Webots\lib\python* folder should not exist

##### Nocturnal Warfare 12/12/2019 07:42:17
oh ok

##### Stefania Pedrazzi [cyberbotics] 12/12/2019 07:42:59
could you please try to manually uninstall Webots before installing R2020a?

##### Nocturnal Warfare 12/12/2019 07:43:34
i will try reinstalling again and make sure to delete the folder before install of 2020a


yeah it look like it was a leftover from the previous install, new install only has the controller folder,

##### Stefania Pedrazzi [cyberbotics] 12/12/2019 07:46:50
just for info did you touch any file in the `<webots>\lib` folder?

##### Nocturnal Warfare 12/12/2019 07:47:11
no

##### Stefania Pedrazzi [cyberbotics] 12/12/2019 07:47:17
ok, thank you

##### Nocturnal Warfare 12/12/2019 07:48:19
i mean what do you mean by touch? like modify? because i have been adding that folder to the VS code workspace and idk exactly what that does


weird it still cannot find that \_controller, the lib folder only has controller.py, vehicle.py and \_controller.pyd, vehicle.pyd fyi. I assume the \_controller its looking for is a .py not a .pyd correct?

##### Stefania Pedrazzi [cyberbotics] 12/12/2019 07:50:14
I'm trying to understand why the uninstaller didn't work correctly, and sometimes the directories are not deleted if the files have beed modified

##### Nocturnal Warfare 12/12/2019 07:50:41
I think it notified me that some files were not deleted but i ignored it. sorry üôÇ

##### Stefania Pedrazzi [cyberbotics] 12/12/2019 07:53:04
In the `<WEBOTS>/lib/controller` directory, could you check that you have libController.dll or Controller.dll, Controller.lib, libController.a, libCppController.dll, CppController.lib, libCppController.a

it appears to be all there

##### Stefania Pedrazzi [cyberbotics] 12/12/2019 07:54:44
ok, good. that's seems correct

##### Nocturnal Warfare 12/12/2019 07:55:07
libCppController.dll seems to be missing actually

##### Stefania Pedrazzi [cyberbotics] 12/12/2019 07:55:50
no it's CppController.dll (I confused with the linux library name)

##### Nocturnal Warfare 12/12/2019 07:55:58
oh ok


CppController.lib is also missing

##### Stefania Pedrazzi [cyberbotics] 12/12/2019 07:57:32
another mistake from my side. I checked and you have all the required libraries

##### Nocturnal Warfare 12/12/2019 07:57:42
ok sweet


and am i right in thinking that if VS Code can see controller.py, and import it properly, it should be able to see \_controller and import that as well?

##### Stefania Pedrazzi [cyberbotics] 12/12/2019 07:58:59
> weird it still cannot find that \_controller, the lib folder only has controller.py, vehicle.py and \_controller.pyd, vehicle.pyd fyi. I assume the \_controller its looking for is a .py not a .pyd correct

the <WEBOTS>/lib/controller/python37/ directory should also contain the \_controller.pyd file

##### Nocturnal Warfare 12/12/2019 07:59:46
yes it has that


is that the file that is referenced by the import \_controller?

##### Stefania Pedrazzi [cyberbotics] 12/12/2019 08:02:12
If I'm not wrong the the .pyd takes preference over the .py

##### Nocturnal Warfare 12/12/2019 08:02:33

##### Stefania Pedrazzi [cyberbotics] 12/12/2019 08:03:42
theoretically this makes sense, but I'm not sure

##### Nocturnal Warfare 12/12/2019 08:03:54
also is that \_controller.pyd supposed to be a text file? because neither VS Code nor notepad++ can read it

##### Stefania Pedrazzi [cyberbotics] 12/12/2019 08:04:52
no, it contains bytes and not text

##### Nocturnal Warfare 12/12/2019 08:05:00
oh ok

##### Stefania Pedrazzi [cyberbotics] 12/12/2019 08:08:19

##### Stefania Pedrazzi [cyberbotics] 12/12/2019 08:16:04
ok, I will now test on my computer if it works and let you know

##### Nocturnal Warfare 12/12/2019 08:16:50
thank you so much, you have been very helpful

##### Stefania Pedrazzi [cyberbotics] 12/12/2019 08:29:16
I could make it work on my system from CMD by also updating the PATH before running python: 

`set PATH=%PATH%;C:\Program Files\Webots\lib\controller;C:\Program Files\Webots\lib\controller\python37`

##### Nocturnal Warfare 12/12/2019 08:31:17
so you ran that in CMD, then python, then import controller?


and it worked?

##### Stefania Pedrazzi [cyberbotics] 12/12/2019 08:31:48
yes, I set both the PATH and PYTHONPATH and then started python and the import was fixed


does it work for you as well?

##### Nocturnal Warfare 12/12/2019 08:32:08
im trying now


how do you set both python path and path?

##### Stefania Pedrazzi [cyberbotics] 12/12/2019 08:32:58
running the two commands I wrote you

##### Nocturnal Warfare 12/12/2019 08:33:20
`set PATH=%PATH%;C:\Program Files\Webots\lib\controller;C:\Program Files\Webots\lib\controller\python37` this does both?

##### Stefania Pedrazzi [cyberbotics] 12/12/2019 08:34:19
no this sets only the PATH, for the PYTHONPATH type:

```
set PYTHONPATH=C:\Program Files\Webots\lib\controller\python37
```

##### Nocturnal Warfare 12/12/2019 08:36:08
```C:\Users\Username>set PYTHONPATH=C:\Program Files\Webots\lib\controller\python37

##### Stefania Pedrazzi [cyberbotics] 12/12/2019 08:37:33
and if you set the path to:

```
set PATH=C:\Program Files\Webots\lib\controller;C:\Program Files\Webots\lib\controller\python37;%PATH%
```


sorry I just edited the previous message

##### Nocturnal Warfare 12/12/2019 08:39:07
nope


is there a way to verify that the path is actually getting set?

##### Stefania Pedrazzi [cyberbotics] 12/12/2019 08:39:50
yes, with `echo %PATH%`

##### Nocturnal Warfare 12/12/2019 08:40:54
yeah both of those new paths are in there

##### Stefania Pedrazzi [cyberbotics] 12/12/2019 08:41:05
or from python 
```import os
print(os.getenv('PATH'))
```

##### Nocturnal Warfare 12/12/2019 08:42:17
both echo and python see both lib\controller and lib\controller\python37


import still failing


how do we make sure the pythonpath is working?


or is that what that python code checks?

##### Stefania Pedrazzi [cyberbotics] 12/12/2019 08:44:05
the error you get is probably due to the PATH and not to PYTHONPATH


it could be that PATH contains other resources that are conflicting with the latest Webots version

##### Nocturnal Warfare 12/12/2019 08:46:06
i can type controller.py from the console, and it opens that file, so im guessing it is finding that path fine

##### Stefania Pedrazzi [cyberbotics] 12/12/2019 08:47:00
but it doesn't find \_controller. on my system I got this error when PATH was not set

##### Nocturnal Warfare 12/12/2019 08:47:22
i wonder if we switch the import in the controller.py to specify the .pyd extension


like import \_controller.pyd

##### Stefania Pedrazzi [cyberbotics] 12/12/2019 08:48:53
I doubt this is the issue, but you can try. I would also try to clean the PATH variable in the terminal and make it link only to the two Webots folders and to the python 37 folder

##### Nocturnal Warfare 12/12/2019 08:49:36
yeah adding the .pyd didnt do anything


how do you set the path variable versus just appending it?

##### Stefania Pedrazzi [cyberbotics] 12/12/2019 08:54:16
if you type ``set PATH=`` you will completely clean it

if you type ``set PATH=C:\Program Files\Webots\lib\controller;C:\Program Files\Webots\lib\controller\python37;`` you will set it only to the Webots lib/controller folders

to append you have type something like this ``set PATH=<new path>;%PATH%``

##### Nocturnal Warfare 12/12/2019 08:54:36
got it thanks


crap, now it doesnt recognize python cuz that path is gone lol

##### Stefania Pedrazzi [cyberbotics] 12/12/2019 08:55:56
yes, you need to add it to the PATH too

##### Nocturnal Warfare 12/12/2019 08:59:31
ok so i have the \lib\controller, \python37, \lib\controller\python37 in my path now


grrr... still failed


```C:\Users\Username>echo %PATH%

##### Nocturnal Warfare 12/12/2019 09:03:43
when I was looking into integrating with PyCharm it said something about adding the mingw64\bin folder as an environment variable or something, is that something not necessary here?


my python installation couldnt be the issue correct since it runs fine in the Webots application right?

##### Stefania Pedrazzi [cyberbotics] 12/12/2019 09:06:50
yes, you are right and you probably also have tp add C:\Program Files\Webots\msys64\mingw64\bin to the PATH as well.

##### Nocturnal Warfare 12/12/2019 09:07:04
ok


didnt help


`PYTHONPATH: C:\Program Files\Webots\lib\controller\python37`

`PATH: C:\Users\Username\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python37\; C:\Program Files\Webots\lib\controller; C:\Program Files\Webots\lib\controller\python37;C:\Program Files\Webots\msys64\mingw64\bin`


thats all correct right? cuz thats currently what they are


wtf it started working

##### Stefania Pedrazzi [cyberbotics] 12/12/2019 09:12:10
yes, can you also try to set the WEBOTS\_HOME variable: ``set WEBOTS\_HOME=C:\Program Files\Webots``?

##### Nocturnal Warfare 12/12/2019 09:12:15
not from console, but from VS Code


........


```PYTHONPATH=C:\Program Files\Webots\lib\controller\python37
PATH=%PATH%;C:\Program Files\Webots\lib\controller;C:\Program Files\Webots\lib\controller\python37;C:\Program Files\Webots\msys64\mingw64\bin
``` is my .env that is loaded using the launch.json


WTF, now it works.... why doesnt the console work tho?

##### Stefania Pedrazzi [cyberbotics] 12/12/2019 09:13:58
the json looks correct

##### Gautier A. 12/12/2019 10:52:51
Hello, I have a question on the execution scheme


How does an execution of a robots's controller/supervisor is inserted in the "global execution scheme" of a simulation ?


And does this execution scheme is gonna change between webots 2019b and 2020a ?


(I'm mainly interested on the wb\_supervisor\_node\_add\_force function that are gonna be available in Webots 2020, and I want to understand how it interacts with ODE and, for exemple, if they (ODE and the controller) are "executed and synchronized" at the same timestamp)

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 12/12/2019 10:58:00
Hi `@Gautier A.` yes they are synchronized, let me check for the exact order.

##### Gautier A. 12/12/2019 11:00:47
Hi `@David Mansolino` , thank you

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 12/12/2019 11:03:26
Ok it works in this order (to summarize), at each step:

  - the controller request is read (i.e. the force is applied).

  - the physic step is executed.

  - the new state of the sensors is sent back to the controllers.



Of course this is in the case where the controller and simulation steps are the same.

##### Gautier A. 12/12/2019 11:05:25
Ok, so the controller are executed before the physics (from ODE ?)


(In the case the controllers and simulation step are the same, of course)

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 12/12/2019 11:05:54
Yes.

##### Gautier A. 12/12/2019 11:07:36
Therefore, if understand correctly, the execution of the controller at time T is based on the data he retrieved from the timestamp T-1 during its execution at T ?


(Also, final question, is the execution scheme gonna change between webots 2019 and 2020 ?)

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 12/12/2019 11:09:32
> Also, final question, is the execution scheme gonna change between webots 2019 and 2020 ?



No



> Therefore, if understand correctly, the execution of the controller at time T is based on the data he retrieved from the timestamp T-1 during its execiton at T ?



Yes

`@Fabien Rohrer` : Hi!  I just got my controller working. üôÇ  But I need to tweak some control coefficients as well as the floor rendering to make it sharper.  At the moment, the e-puck can't detect the lines while turning around, and may also be unable to detect intersections.  So, going quite well.


`@David Mansolino` :  Thanks for the link to the E-Puck demo.  It helped me a lot!


(Tutorial)

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 12/12/2019 14:02:10
`@nap` you're welcome, glad to hear that it helped üôÇ

##### nap 12/12/2019 14:04:17
I have a question about PBRAppearance settings.  I would like to get a really sharp rendering of my floor texture (png).  Roughness 1 and metalness 1  (or both on zero) just don't cut it.  Either the line is dim and diffused, or it's just out of focus.


Anyone know what settings would help?

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 12/12/2019 14:05:36
I am not sure to understand exactly what you want to achieve, do you want the floor to belike a mirror ?

##### Hayden Woodger 12/12/2019 14:07:24
Sounds like he wants the floor to be HD

##### nap 12/12/2019 14:08:07
no, not a mirror.  My texture has a (almost) black floor (it's actually a shade of really dark red), with bright white lines that intersect in a grid.  At each intersection I have a cyan square which lets the robot know when it's in the right position in the intersection so it can make aligned turns.


No aliasing, no merging.  I would like maximum contrast between the floor, lines, and intersection marker.


(With sharp edges between each.)


(And for the floor to look sharp.)


lol, so hard to express what I want, now that I'm trying to find the right words.

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 12/12/2019 14:11:25
Ok,, in that case you probably want:

  - metalness 0

  - roughness 1

  - baseColorMap.filtering 0



Make also sur to set in the preference OpenGL.Texture Quality to high


Let me know if that helps

##### nap 12/12/2019 14:12:20
Where does 'baseColorMap.filtering 0' go?  In the same PBR stanza?

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 12/12/2019 14:12:50
you did add a texure using the basColorMap field rights ?

##### nap 12/12/2019 14:13:16
yes I did

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 12/12/2019 14:13:32
then the node in basColorMap you should see a 'filtering' field

##### nap 12/12/2019 14:13:57
This is what I have atm:



  floorAppearance PBRAppearance {

    baseColorMap ImageTexture {

      url [

        "textures/Floor\_10px\_small\_Inter\_center\_boarder\_infra-red31\_1024.png"

      ]

    }

    roughness 1

    metalness 0

  }


just add it after metalness?

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 12/12/2019 14:14:36
You probably want this:

```
floorAppearance PBRAppearance {
    baseColorMap ImageTexture {
      url [
        "textures/Floor_10px_small_Inter_center_boarder_infra-red31_1024.png"

      filtering 0

    roughness 1
    metalness 0
  }

##### nap 12/12/2019 14:18:18
(Note that the 2nd image is from a Webots7 simulation video.)


To me, it looks like there is a layer of old plexiglass over the floor that has clouded due to UV exposure.


Or someone poured some acetone onto it.


Its like here is some 'grey' color in the image.

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 12/12/2019 14:21:09
But can you share the texture 'Floor\_10px\_small\_Inter\_center\_boarder\_infra-red31\_1024.png' just to see how it looks like ?

##### nap 12/12/2019 14:21:14
The colours are specifically chosen to be at maximum extremes from each other to make the GroundSensors work best.

##### nap 12/12/2019 14:26:56
Could it have something to do with the lights?  I have two DirectionalLight nodes.  There were also there in the Webots7 project,  I haven't changed any of their settings, but perhaps this version of Webots uses a different lighting model?


To me, there is still a layer of gray.  The red isn't deep enough.

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 12/12/2019 14:28:08
Yes, the lightning might influence the rendering for sure, and also the background !

##### nap 12/12/2019 14:29:41
Well, I really appreciate you looking into this.  I need to calibrate some of my coefficients to suit the new e-puck, so I may be able to get it working with what I have.

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 12/12/2019 14:30:39
Ok, let us know if you can't find any working calibration, I am sure we can find some other solution if needed

##### nap 12/12/2019 15:19:51
Is there a way of getting the simulation to run more smoothly?  I reduced TIME\_STEP from 64 to 32.


I disabled "Ambient Occlusion" in the OpenGL settings, and it's much better now!!

##### ega 12/12/2019 20:15:33
why is my robot stopped after calling robot->step(32) ?

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 12/13/2019 07:29:07
Hi `@ega` what do you mean by is stopped? is it only the robo or the simulation too?

##### nap 12/13/2019 07:32:52
`@David Mansolino` : His message was around 9 hours ago.  So I'm not sure what happened.

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 12/13/2019 07:33:14
Indeed let's wait and see if he comes back or not.

##### nap 12/13/2019 07:34:12
I got my controller calibrated to suit the new units of measure.  Works great!


The only issue I have at the moment is that whilst I can build my project inside the Webots Editor, I'm not able to do so from the CLI.

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 12/13/2019 07:45:42
Very good news !


What is your compilation issue? Did you define correctly WEBOTS\_HOME before trying to compile ?

##### Gautier A. 12/13/2019 09:19:42
Hey, Might I ask you something ?

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 12/13/2019 09:19:51
Of course

##### Gautier A. 12/13/2019 09:19:57
Thank you ! `@David Mansolino`


I'm experimenting with the new functions of the supervisor and I don't really understand how they behave


I have made a video to show you: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fF0xkMFGZTQ&feature=youtu.be](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fF0xkMFGZTQ&feature=youtu.be)



Basically, I test a motor on a hinge joint in zero gravity and observe how the two solid react.

 - When a torque is applied to the joint through a motor (first mode, "motor mode"), the two solid react correctly according to their own mass and inertial matrix

 - When a torque is applied through a supervisor on the endsolid, we have two kind of different behavior depending on the initial condition:

           - If there was no initial linear velocity, the two solid rotate in the same sense, even though there is a joint between them (this behavior is not shown in the video above, I'm gonna link you another video right after)

           - If there was an initial linear velocity, only the endpoint solid spin


Did I do something wrong ? Do I need to apply a torque of the same intensity but in the other sense to simulate the "normal behavior" of mecanics ?


Here is the behavior when a torque is applied on endsolid through a supervisor at the beginning of simulation (so without any linear velocity at the beginning): [https://youtu.be/nn7nhfxPxrQ](https://youtu.be/nn7nhfxPxrQ)

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 12/13/2019 09:37:22
Can you reproduce similar behavior simply by adding torque/force manually?

[https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/the-3d-window#applying-a-force-to-a-solid-object-with-physics](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/the-3d-window#applying-a-force-to-a-solid-object-with-physics)

##### Gautier A. 12/13/2019 09:49:41
Yes, of course


[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiH2hsKYLzc&feature=youtu.be](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiH2hsKYLzc&feature=youtu.be)


The two solid are considered "one" even though there is an hinge joint between them

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 12/13/2019 09:51:53
Ok, this is kind of reassuring at least the behavior is the same in both cases.

##### Gautier A. 12/13/2019 09:52:21
Here is the scene tree, Maybe I did an error in it ?
%figure

%end


Yeah, I agree

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 12/13/2019 09:52:35
Just to make sure, you have a motor in the joint lonking the two solid ?

##### Gautier A. 12/13/2019 09:52:52
Yes


Do you want me to send my world and controller ?

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 12/13/2019 09:53:40
Ok, then this is probably the cause of the issue, the motor is applying some torque to make sure the joint remains at the 0 position. Can you try the same without the motor ?

##### Gautier A. 12/13/2019 09:57:46
[https://youtu.be/8SqgdZr4MTQ](https://youtu.be/8SqgdZr4MTQ)


Without motor, it has this kind of behavior


You were right


I assume that, than, to completly simulate the "expected behavior" (by that, I mean, the reaction of torque in the opposite sense on the base), I have to put a torque inverse to the first one on the solid node of the base ?


(I understand now why it had this kind of behavior for the first video, I assume it was because after controlling the motor directly in torque, the "PID" switch off so the motor no longer try to stay in position "0" ?)

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 12/13/2019 10:03:03
Very good news, it now makes much more sense.



>  I have to put a torque inverse to the first one on the solid node of the base



Yes, that's probabyl the best solution.



> I understand now why it had this kind of behavior for the first video, I assume it was because after controlling the motor directly in torque, the "PID" switch off so the motor no longer try to stay in position "0" ?



If you want to keep the motor, to disable it you can probably call the `wb_motor_set_available_torque` with a zero torque ([https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/motor#motor-functions](https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/motor#motor-functions))

`@David Mansolino` : I solved the CLI problem...  I needed to prepend the the `make` command with `CXX=clang++` (as I'm on MacOS here).


I've updated my Makefile now.

##### nap 12/13/2019 14:01:36
`@David Mansolino` : I'm experiencing a strange problem here.  In some folders, `make` ends up generating a dylib (shared library) instead of an executable. Does `make` have a default location where it checks for Makefiles?  I thought it was just the local directory or if specified, at a given path.

Yes, it should be included in this one: [https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots/releases](https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots/releases)


`@nap`, yes if you do not specify any path, make is executing the Makefile in the current folder

##### nap 12/13/2019 14:42:22
`@David Mansolino` : I figured it out.

`Makefile.include` relies on a hierarchy of folders for various things;

1. The name of the controller is assigned from the name of the containing folder, 

2, If there is a folder named 'controllers' in the branch (presumably one level above), then the code is compiled to an executable, otherwise a shared library, and

3. Maybe other things which I haven't worked out yet.

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 12/13/2019 14:45:08
You are completely right, the makefile.include assumes that you are using the Webots project standard file hierarchy: [https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/the-standard-file-hierarchy-of-a-project](https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/the-standard-file-hierarchy-of-a-project)

the value you see on the scene tree is indeed rounded to few decimals.

the perfect value can be found from the API or is stored in the .wbt file using a double precision.

`@David Mansolino` :Problem solved.  I needed to add a line in my Makefile with the following: `LFLAGS=-Wl,-rpath-link,/usr/local/webots/lib/webots` parameters, and it's worked.


`@David Mansolino` : Well, that almost worked.  It generated a binary, but upon running it, it issued an error stating it could not find  `libCppController.so`.  This is confirmed by using `ldd` on my controller.


`@David Mansolino` :  I made a little progress.  Setting the link command to:

`g++ -Wl,-rpath-link,"/usr/local/webots/lib/webots/",-rpath-link,"/usr/local/webots/lib/controller/" -Wl,-R "/usr/local/webots/lib/controller/" -s -o build/release/ePuckMeander build/release/ePuck.o build/release/ePuckMeanderBhvr.o build/release/ePuckContainer.o -lm -L"/usr/local/webots/lib/controller" -lController -lCppController`



Fixed the `libCppController.so` runtime error, but now it's complaining about libController.so.  

I would have thought that given the two are in the same folder specified by `-rpath-link` this would be fixed.  However, since I'm not actually building `libCppController.so`, it may be the reason.



By setting `LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/webots/lib/controller/` fixed the problem, but I would consider this a bandaid solution.


`@David Mansolino` :  I've found that under MacOS, I have the same problem with `libController.dylib`.  The runtime error is:



`dyld: Library not loaded: @rpath/lib/libController.dylib

  Referenced from: /Users/user/src/webots/projects/controllers/ePuckIface/./build.host/ePuckIface

  Reason: image not found`



And as before, setting `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` makes the problem go away.

##### swebdev 12/28/2019 23:40:36
`@Shanks` You could try to get your hands dirty on [http://robotbenchmark.net/](http://robotbenchmark.net/) which is fun. The next step would be to follow the tutorials here: [https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/tutorials?tab-language=java](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/tutorials?tab-language=java) . As you start going with it, the further next step will be to stick to the rest of the documentation.

Is Webots a good simulator for Multi-agent planning ? It will be a great help if I get a brief comparison of gazebo and Webots for ROS integration.

##### Tahir [Moderator] 12/30/2019 08:31:00
Well I am using Webots for multi agents planning. I would say it's great. I haven't worked with Gazebo quite much, but we already had simulation for single robot in Gazebo(which I didn't worked on, my supervisor did, he said that it might not work for multiple robots in our scenario we can just try) so I moved on to Webots. It didn't gave me much hard time as compared to other ones. I imported my custom robot. Wrote interfaces for Webots services and our custom software. Than just created multiple instances of robots in Webots, run multiple software instances and eveything worked.


Webots ROS handling is also good everything is in form of services which might make life easier at some points

##### HBK 12/30/2019 18:28:39
`@Tahir` Great !!!  Thank you very much.  I am planning to work with 10 robots wont creating multiple instances make process slow ?

##### Tahir [Moderator] 12/30/2019 18:39:39
Well I have 25 I will suggest use asynchronous mode that will not create much load and will update every robot individually, initially I was using synchronous so robots sometimes got out of the planned path. Also in my case visuals are not important I have everything in rviz. So previously when I run without graphics it didn't worked at all because ros and webots frequencies were different so it didn't made sense, now in asynchronous if I run without graphics robots stays on path.

Also I connected two pcs directly with lan, one running just webots and another just ros, so in this way its working well for me.

##### HBK 12/30/2019 18:48:46
I am well verse with ROS and gazebo. What will be best way to start shifting my project in webots `@Tahir`


Brief of my project details:


I have multi-drone system with 4 drones working in an environment. Where I am applying Travelling salesmen Problem (K-TSP) to solve the issue.

So In gazebo sometimes drones fell down

In Gazebo

##### Tahir [Moderator] 12/31/2019 11:24:45
1. you can start import your robot model in Webots. You can use urdf2webots or some other plugins available on Webots gihub. The model produced will be a little crude. So you can start organizing the stuff e.g. naming sensors and actuators, setting up the fields with resepctive bounding objects etc and atlast you can make a proto if you want. There are alot of example protos you can just change them to base node and see the hieracrhy there is also DJI drone in webots you can check that as well. 



2. After that I will say check the robots maneuverabilty that it moves in the correct direction and orientation for example teleopate on a line and a circle. 



3. Next is just write a small script which at the start enables webots devices. 



4. Webots is left handed system whereas ROS is right handed. This was another problem which I faced so there was two options one to write a transformation which actually does the correct mappings or another to change webots simulation to right handed, so I have gone for the second I changedevery nodes perspective which is now perfectly fine this will have some graphics issues but thats dependant on your need what do you want.


5. I will again highly suggest using asynchronous mode with this you can also run the headless mode and the robot will for sure wait for the commads and hopefully there will be no problem but I am not expert may be there might somone else shed light on this


I will suggest spending a little more time on step one and two and making sure that everything is 101% working as expected becase if there is a problem at this point this might give you hard time and you might see random behaviour

##### HBK 12/31/2019 20:55:15
As you are emphasizing more on asynchronous mode can I know the trade offs of using this mode.(Mostly cons over synchronous mode)

##### Tahir [Moderator] 12/31/2019 20:56:54
[https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/robot#synchronous-versus-asynchronous-controllers](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/robot#synchronous-versus-asynchronous-controllers)


like here on this link you can see asynchronous waits for webots\_robot\_step to execute


sorry I forgot to mention in my case the local planner takes some time so I to synchronize or in other words to wait for ros to plan everything I did that


so I would say it depends upon your requirements so just try it

##### HBK 12/31/2019 21:02:32
`@Tahir` Thank you very much these were really useful insights.

##### Tahir [Moderator] 12/31/2019 21:03:40

## 2020

##### Shanaka 01/02/2020 08:10:14
currently working as a research engineer in the department of electrical and electronic engineering, University of Peradeniya, Sri Lanka. These days, I engaged to design simulation using PUMA 560 robot manipulator in WEBOT and note that I'm very new to webot. 



I modified the end-tool of the manipulator by replacing the Pioneer gripper



I  control this entire manipulator (with new gripper) by modifying puma560.motion file and puma560.c file. 



But I need to add dynamics and individual joint controllers to this simulation with the idea of implementation in real world. So i check puma560.c file and there I found  functions called 



wbu\_motion\_new("puma560\_1.motion");

wbu\_motion\_play(motion);

but I was not able to find the definition of these functions anywhere. ( I checked motion.h Motion.hpp Motion.cpp files.) Although I can find the function definitions inside the above-mentioned files, still I was not able to find function definitions and how the given angles fed to motors in the manipulator by wbu\_motion\_play() function. 



The final target is to implement the controller in the real world using Raspberry pi or FPGA microcontrollers. So by using wbu\_motion\_play() functions how can I do it? Where can I find the function description? If this method is impossible, it will be great if you can give guidance to make it a success. 



your response will be highly appreciated !!


this is my modified PUMA560

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 01/03/2020 07:32:57
`@Shanaka` instead of using motion file you should control directly the motor individually  (in speed, position or torque/force) using the motor API: [https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/motor#motor-functions](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/motor#motor-functions)

You can easily get the name of the individual motors by double-clicking on the robot to open the robot-window.

IF you didn't already did, I strongly recommend to follow our tutorial (which explains how to control the motors individually): [https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/tutorials](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/tutorials)


`@BoBo73` Unfortunately the motion editor is not available in the latest version of Webots anymore, instead you should use directly motor control: [https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/motor#motor-functions](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/motor#motor-functions)


`@„ÄéDEM√é„ÄèGhozt (Redsign)` and `@sugus105`, you can export your robot in VRML from SolidWorks and then import this VRML file in Webots directly (not that this will import only the shapes, you will then have to add solids, bounding objects, physics, sensors, etc.). Or import from SolidWorks to Blender and then Blender to Webots, here is an example with Catia (Solidworks works similarly): [https://youtu.be/L0FVsFD2rS4](https://youtu.be/L0FVsFD2rS4)


`@Tahir`, there are many ways to increase the lightning of your scene, have you tried increasing the value of the Background.luminosity field for example?


`@swebdev`, if it is the root node you can simply add a bounding object without any Physics node. Otherwise you can use a SolidReference and set it's 'solidName' field to '<static environment>' ([https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/solidreference](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/solidreference))


`@SomeOne`, yes you can use Blender to create your robot model and then export it to PROTO using our Blender-to-Webots converter: [https://github.com/cyberbotics/blender-webots-exporter](https://github.com/cyberbotics/blender-webots-exporter)


`@Shanks`, yes, it is highly recommended to start with the tutorials: [https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/tutorials](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/tutorials)


`@nap`, are you trying to launch your controller yourself as an 'extern' controller?

##### yash 01/03/2020 09:34:20
I am facing an issue to import the robot from solidworks to Webots . Can anyone please help regarding this problem.?

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 01/03/2020 09:34:51
`@yash` yes, what is your issue ?

##### yash 01/03/2020 09:37:58
I have converted the solidworks file in VRML format ... but at the time of import in webots error occurs.


I wanted to know the exact steps to import the file in Webots since its not mentioned in the documentation/reference manual.

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 01/03/2020 09:41:08
What are exactly the error you get?

It might be normal that you get some errors since Webots doesn't implements all the fields of VRML (such as colorPerVertex for example), but this shouldn't prevent the shape to be functionnal.

##### yash 01/03/2020 09:48:33

%end

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 01/03/2020 09:51:47
The `Separator` node is indeed not supported in Webots.


Please make sure when you export from SolidWorks that you select VRML97 and not another version of VRML.

##### yunus [Moderator] 01/04/2020 20:34:12
Hello. We want to use Webots to implement a simple physical model: one solid mass joined by a spring to a stationary mass (to a wall for example). We want the spring to oscillate continuously as it would be in real life. We came across this description: [https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/jointparametersfound](https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/jointparametersfound), we want to implement that figure "Mechanical Diagram of a Slider Joint" at the end of that webpage.



We found SliderJoint.wrl in the ..resources/nodes folder of Webots, but we couldn't import it in Webots, and there is no node in Webots that accomplish that spring motion.



Can you please give us a lead on how to proceed? Thank you so much

##### musabcoskun 01/05/2020 08:42:26
`@David Mansolino`I'm using Firefox n Chrome on Ubuntu 16.04 n Windows 10

##### yash 01/05/2020 13:09:05
I have imported my solidworks model into webots. How do we define the motors and sensors on the CAD model .?


So that I can make the controller accordingly.

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 01/06/2020 07:41:00
`@yunus`, you are in the right direction, using a sliderjoint ([https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/sliderjoint](https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/sliderjoint)) and setting appropriate jointparameters ([https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/jointparameters](https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/jointparameters)) is indeed the way to go.

Here are the steps:

  - Add a Solid node (which a bounding object but no physics) this is your wall (it is static since there is no physics).

  - In the children field of the Solid add a SliderJoint.

  - In the `jointParamerters` field of the SliderJoint add a JointParameters node.

  - In the `endPoint` field of the SliderJoint add a Solid node (which is your moving mass with physics).


`@musabcoskun`, ok thank yo ufor the confirmation, I have logged this in our bug tracker and we will fix this soon: [https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots/issues/1235](https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots/issues/1235)


`@yash`, you have to add the motors and sensors in Webots directly after importing your CAD model, you should probably have a look at this tutorial explaining how to create your own robot model: [https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/tutorial-6-4-wheels-robot](https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/tutorial-6-4-wheels-robot)

Hello,

I am using Webots with ros to simualte warehouse environments and forklifts. I am using Webots in asynchronous mode and using Webots simulation time as reference. 

Currently I am validating the simulation with our real experimental data from the warehouse. I am running the simulation in Fast mode.  initially the simulation starts with 18 to 20x speed and the robot runs blvery fast but its OK because it is taking round trip on average in 8.5 minutes which is true in real as well. 

But after 18 or 20 hours the robots gets too slow, ros is running fine no error at ros side I can see the commands published, no error in Webots. Data is also being exchanged as expected. None of the computational resources exhausted.


Due to this slow motion of tue robot now round trip time goes to 20 30 minutes.


I really am not getting what could be the problem

This cloud warning is fine, but here in the screenshot the velocity amd angles are continously sent but robots position updates too slowly

##### Stefania Pedrazzi [cyberbotics] 01/06/2020 16:43:11
`@Tahir` it could be that there are some internal data that is not managed efficiently and will slow down the simulation. But it is difficult to tell without looking in details at your simulation. 

Are you using the Supervisor API for updating the robot position?

Are you creating/deleting many nodes?

Did you notice if the memory usage continuously increase while running the simulation?

##### Tahir [Moderator] 01/06/2020 16:44:51
Hello,

I am using motor control to steer the robot not suoervisor api, not deleting any node from the scene tree,  memory consumption is same as at the start.


Non of the resources are exhasuted, also I am using to PCs directly connected via lan so I think no lag in the communication as well.


One is running hustvWebots and another just robot softwar

##### User21 01/06/2020 16:51:32
Hi,

I am new to Webots and i want to use MoveIT with the UR5e.

I have several questions:

1.If i try to launch MOVEIT! like in the documentation written i always get this error message:



Resource not found: ur\_e\_description

ROS path [0]=/opt/ros/melodic/share/ros

ROS path [1]=/home/arches/catkin\_ws/src

ROS path [2]=/opt/ros/melodic/share

The traceback for the exception was written to the log file

(I just copied the file ur\_e\_webots in my catkin workspace)

Is it possible to use MoveIT with other Manipulators like the KUKA YouBot?

Is it possible to use the ros Package navigation?

##### Stefania Pedrazzi [cyberbotics] 01/06/2020 16:52:59
The fact that the resources where not exhausted let me think that it could be an internal problem. But if you are not deleting/creating nodes and you are not using the Supervisor API (that could be affected by the changes in the scene tree) the problem is not where I though it could be.

If could try to simplify your simulation as much as possible so that it still reproduces the issue but in a simple example (maybe running a simple controller on one machine) we will take a look at it to try to understand what is the problem.

##### Tahir [Moderator] 01/06/2020 16:54:44
Well just to clarify I am using Supervisor API but not for robot motion control.


This is the simplest I can run now


It is just one robot in Webots and nothing else at all


I am intended to ise it for multiple robots may be 10 or 20 in that case I can say the world would be complex but not in the case now I think so

##### Stefania Pedrazzi [cyberbotics] 01/06/2020 16:59:22
ok, so then if your controller is also simple and you are available to send it to us (for example using Gist) we will look at it. But it should work out of the box on a single machine, otherwise it would be difficult to reproduce the issue.


Hi `@User21`,

you can use any ros package to connect with the Webots ROS interface.

About using MoveIT with other robots you should probably refer to the MoveIT documentation, but a priori I think that yes you can do it after configuring it.

 Do you have the `universal_robots` package installed?

##### User21 01/06/2020 17:17:35
`@Stefania Pedrazzi` 

First of all thank you for your fast response.

I didnt install it, so i think this is the porblem i thought it is automatically installed wth Webots


`@Stefania Pedrazzi` 

it woked but if i want to start the simulation i get the error message: WARNING: cannot create log directory [ros\_python\_log]. Please set ROS\_LOG\_DIR to a writable location.

##### lunarpulse 01/06/2020 23:32:26
Hi everyone,

Have you done use Webot as the basis of Reinforcement Learning? I saw some ROS developers using Gazebo to train robotic arms. I want to hear experienced people's opinion.

##### Nocturnal Warfare 01/07/2020 02:29:53
are there any tutorials involving python with keyboard control of a robot, like WASD control of a wheeled robot. I specifically would need it through an external controller but that is a problem for another day.

##### Stefania Pedrazzi [cyberbotics] 01/07/2020 07:10:25
`@Nocturnal Warfare` you could check the `altino.wbt` simulation (in `projects/robots/saeon/worlds` folder): in this Python controller after pressing M to enable the manual control, the wheeled robot is controlled using the arrows keys.


About external controller I would suggest you to check the documentation [https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/running-extern-robot-controllers](https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/running-extern-robot-controllers)

After setting the required environmental variables it should work the same as in Webots


`@User21` you should probably check where does your ROS\_LOG\_DIR variable point to and make sure that it exists and that is writable

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 01/07/2020 07:36:09
> I didnt install it, so i think this is the porblem i thought it is automatically installed wth Webots

`@User21`, no it is not installed automatically with our ROS1 interface (it is with our ROS2 package).


`@lunarpulse`, we have a documentation about using numerical optimization with Webots that might be of interest for you: [https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/using-numerical-optimization-methods](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/using-numerical-optimization-methods)

##### Dr. Sudip Chakraborty 01/07/2020 10:41:25

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 01/07/2020 10:44:01
Hi `@Dr. Sudip Chakraborty`, we do not provide such example (we do provide a Python example) but you can fore sure find some libraries on internet that does this, e.g. [http://openrave.org/docs/0.8.2/openravepy/ikfast/](http://openrave.org/docs/0.8.2/openravepy/ikfast/)

##### Dr. Sudip Chakraborty 01/07/2020 10:46:00
can i use ikpy for industrial use?

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 01/07/2020 10:47:36
I am not sure, you should probably directly ask the developers of the libraries.

But since it is the library behind moveit used by ROS it is probably quite safe.

##### Dr. Sudip Chakraborty 01/07/2020 10:51:27
I have trouble pls help me.  I am moving my arm using ikpy from my c# application over socket. in webots end  tcp server is running for receiving the command. after creating the server object webots not responding . server running in separate thread. what is the issue?


I want to exchange data between webots and other pc application. what is the correct procedure?

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 01/07/2020 11:16:30
You can simply use any communication protocol (such as TCP IP for example) from within your controller to communicate with another computer.

##### Dr. Sudip Chakraborty 01/07/2020 11:22:09
which is more reliable ? phython socket  or  c/cpp socket

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 01/07/2020 11:22:30
Both are equivalent if correctly implemented.

##### Dr. Sudip Chakraborty 01/07/2020 11:24:31
can  run separate thread  for TCP server in python?

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 01/07/2020 11:25:58
Yes of course.

is there any shared variable feature to exchange data between webots and others app?

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 01/07/2020 11:57:35
No, there is the emitter-receiver mechanism to communicate between controllers, but to communicate with other apps since many standard ways are already existing there is no specific mechanism to Webots.

Hi! I'm currently in my final year engineering and am doing a project in robotics, wanted to know if webots will be of any help or i should look at other softwares?


PS- I'm making a special type of exoskeleton

##### Tahir [Moderator] 01/07/2020 19:45:18
Hello,

For comparison There is great article on Wikipedia you can have a look at it. 

For exeskeleton I think it is possible but I haven't did anything on it. But to the extent I know Webots it should be possible

Importing the CAD file from Solidworks has resulted into so many tranforms i.e one tranform corresponds to one shape .


therefore how to reduce them .?

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 01/08/2020 06:51:44
`@yash` once imported you may want to remove usless small shapes (such as screws, etc.) then you can group your shapes together using the Group node.

You might also merge your shapes directly in Solidworks before exporting your model.

##### jyuan 01/08/2020 09:26:02
Hi, guys, if I want to import some solid model like some plants in greenhouse like tomatos, how can I do?

##### Tahir [Moderator] 01/08/2020 09:27:21
Hello,

I am using Webots with ros to simualte warehouse environments and forklifts. I am using Webots in asynchronous mode and using Webots simulation time as reference. 

Currently I am validating the simulation with our real experimental data from the warehouse. I am running the simulation in Fast mode.  initially the simulation starts with 18 to 20x speed and the robot runs blvery fast but its OK because it is taking round trip on average in 8.5 minutes which is true in real as well. 

But after 18 or 20 hours the robots gets too slow, ros is running fine no error at ros side I can see the commands published, no error in Webots. Data is also being exchanged as expected. None of the computational resources exhausted.


Guys any thoughts I'm still having the problem

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 01/08/2020 09:29:04
Not really, is one of your robots kind of stuck or having many collision? You might want to check the contact points to make sure there is not an 'explosion' of th enumber of contact points. This is just an idea but might not be the cause.

##### Tahir [Moderator] 01/08/2020 09:29:29
Nothing is in the environment


Just a single robot


I am runing simulation in fast mode


And all the visualization is in rviz


This is after 24 hours of sinulation in fast mode

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 01/08/2020 09:31:01
You mean your robot is alone floating in the air (this would be an ideal scnario to make sure the simulation part is not the bottlneck) ?

##### Tahir [Moderator] 01/08/2020 09:31:25
No no not in the air


I mean there is just one robot and a floor

##### yash 01/08/2020 09:31:49
thank you `@David Mansolino`  problem solved.!

##### Tahir [Moderator] 01/08/2020 09:31:52
This is for validation I will use multiple


The robot is on ground but moving really really too slow

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 01/08/2020 09:34:52
can you try to make it float in the air? simply remove everything else than the robot.

##### Tahir [Moderator] 01/08/2020 09:36:59
And than runing the simulation?


It will fall down

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 01/08/2020 09:39:18
Yes exactly, it's probably not a problem if it falls down, and worse case you can set the 'WorldInfo.gravity' to '0 0 0'-

##### Stefania Pedrazzi [cyberbotics] 01/08/2020 09:40:46
`@jyuan` you can import your model in Webots saving it in VRML format (from the File menu select "Import VRML97").

Another option is to import your model in Blender and then user this Blender plugin to import in in Webots:

[https://github.com/cyberbotics/blender-webots-exporter](https://github.com/cyberbotics/blender-webots-exporter)

##### Tahir [Moderator] 01/08/2020 09:50:08
OK I'll try that


Just a question for the ros service


If I don't call the /robot/time\_step service the robot should not move right?


What I want to is until I get some data the robot should stop

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 01/08/2020 10:48:14
The simulation will not run as long as you don't call the step service and you use the `--synchronize` argument.

##### Tahir [Moderator] 01/08/2020 10:53:02
Will this be the same for multiple robots running in different threads


Or should I wait for all robots to get the data and than call this service once

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 01/08/2020 10:53:55
Yes, if each robot is using it's own ros controller and has the `--synchronize` argument it will wait for each robot to call the service.

##### Tahir [Moderator] 01/08/2020 10:58:09
I just commented this service call part in my code and the robots are still moving

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 01/08/2020 11:35:12
Did you add the `--synchronize` in controllerArgs field?

##### sunnyjerai 01/08/2020 12:36:40

##### Fabien Rohrer [Moderator] 01/08/2020 12:37:33
You selected the correct field üôÇ


You just need to remove the node in the RectangleArena.floorAppearance, and add another appearance instead.


Webots comes with an appearance set: [https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/appearances](https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/appearances)


You could choose one of them, or add directly a PBRAppearance node, and play with its parameters.

##### sunnyjerai 01/08/2020 12:40:30
Understood, Thanks a lot for the help üòÑ

##### Tahir [Moderator] 01/08/2020 12:55:29
In a multi robot scenario in syncronized setup.

We can do two things.

1. Wait for all robots cmd vel, when everything is available, than call one robot/time\_step service to update the simulation. 

1.1.Is it ok to call just one service robot/time\_step for update of all of the robots or we have to call service for every single robot.

2. Not waiting for all robots data contrary to above approach, for every robot whenever the data is available call its own service to uodate the simulation. 

2.1. In this case multiple robots will update time is this OK


So my question is are these two cases equivalent in Webots and what about the time gaurantees


Will the time updated in bith cases be the same or not if not which one is the correct simulation time

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 01/08/2020 13:09:14
with the syncronized setup, you should need to call the step for each robot, otherwise the simulation will block.

##### Tahir [Moderator] 01/08/2020 13:17:22
OK also will these above steps be similar

##### User21 01/08/2020 16:12:20

is it possible to change the kuka youbot gripper?

##### Fabien Rohrer [Moderator] 01/08/2020 16:12:48
Hi


yes, it's possible.


you can convert the youBot PROTO node to base node, by rightclicking on it in the scene tree, and select "Convert to Base node."


Once this is done, you could modify all the nodes defining the robot, including the gripper.

Hi its me again üòÖ 

sorry for these questions but,

is it possible to load the webots world file in "MoveIT" so that it can  consider the obstacles and plan around it?

To my knowledge MoveIT only accepts URDF or Collada files.

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 01/09/2020 06:53:22
`@Dr. Sudip Chakraborty`, no idea, you should probably check in the doc: [https://ikpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/genindex.html](https://ikpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/genindex.html)


`@azpi` if you use the default Webots Makefile you don't need to care about this.

But in any case these files are located in WEBOTS\_HOME/include/controller/c (see: [https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots/tree/master/include/controller/c/webots](https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots/tree/master/include/controller/c/webots) )


`@User21` unfortunately not directly, however, you can export the world in VRML format from Webots: File => Export VRML97...

Then you can use a software (e.g. Blender) to convert VRML to any other format (such as Collada).

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 01/09/2020 08:42:41
Hi `@sunnyjerai`, your code seems correct, can you add a print(ds) right after the ds.append ?

##### ClBaze 01/09/2020 09:34:07
Hi guys, I'd like to simulate an attitude and orbit control system.

The simulated spacecraft would have 4 gyros, 3 star trackers, 6 reaction wheels and 16 thrusters.

I want to implement custom noise models for each sensor and actuator.

My first idea was to do this in the webots controller of the robot node containing all these components (the spacecraft).

But as these devices work at different frequencies, I think it's not the best idea.

What do you think if I put each device in a robot node with its own controller, and all these robot nodes in another robot node (the spacecraft).

I mean it makes a lot of executables (webots controllers), do you think Webots could handle it ?

##### Fabien Rohrer [Moderator] 01/09/2020 09:35:23
Hi,


Webots can indeed handle this.


A Robot can contain other Robot instances with their own controllers.


You have to implement a way to dialog between them (for example using an Emitter/Receiver)


However, I think this is a complex solution: from my experiment, having a single, well structured and single-threaded controller is always simpler to implement and more robust.

##### sunnyjerai 01/09/2020 10:15:04
Hi `@David Mansolino` , I added print(ds) as you suggested and this is the result.
%figure
![controller_error_ds.jpg](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/565154703139405824/664774134730981376/controller_error_ds.jpg)
%end

##### Stefania Pedrazzi [cyberbotics] 01/09/2020 10:23:32
`@sunnyjerai` did you double checked if the device names defined in the DistanceSensor.name field of your robot are  "ds\_left" and "ds\_right"?

##### sunnyjerai 01/09/2020 10:25:50
Yes , that's first thing I checked


They are correct

##### Stefania Pedrazzi [cyberbotics] 01/09/2020 10:27:58
I suspect there is some issue with the names, because the devices are not found.


Note that from a robot controller you can get only a device defined inside the Robot model running the controller and you cannot access devices of other robots. Not sure if this is the case in your simulation.

##### sunnyjerai 01/09/2020 10:30:50
This is the name given to the left line sensor
%figure
![ds_left.jpg](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/565154703139405824/664778102135848970/ds_left.jpg)
%end


and this one is of the right
%figure
![ds_right.jpg](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/565154703139405824/664778167231315968/ds_right.jpg)
%end


so I think that there might be something else at play

##### Stefania Pedrazzi [cyberbotics] 01/09/2020 10:31:28
Ok. Your sensor is a LightSensor and not a DistanceSensor.

##### sunnyjerai 01/09/2020 10:31:44
okay, understood

##### Stefania Pedrazzi [cyberbotics] 01/09/2020 10:32:04
you should use `robot.getLightSensor('ds_left')`

##### sunnyjerai 01/09/2020 10:32:53

Hi. For city.wbt, I want to find the coordinates of the lane. The idea is to find the deviation of the current position of the car from the centre of the lane. The current position could be obtained from the GPS coordinate. However, I was wondering if there is a way to obtain the coordinates of the centre of the lane.

##### sunnyjerai 01/11/2020 10:44:20
Hello everyone, I imported a VRML file of my robot chassis which appeared as multiple transforms. I then proceeded to make a robot node in the scene tree and used the DEF strings from all those transforms to define the body of the robot. I wanted to make this robot as a proto node for the project so I followed the steps in tutorial 7.  After that, the Robot did appear in proto nodes, however the body is missing and I got the error as shown in the picture. The 2 wheels and distance sensors appeared since they were defined separately.

##### Tahir [Moderator] 01/11/2020 10:46:51
It says you haven't defined bounding object in each solid you can define that


Also robot is used twice names should be unique


For hounding objects I think you can chwck the tutorials as well

##### sunnyjerai 01/11/2020 11:32:23
The definition of bounding objects were taken from transforms


I think i might be getting the error since the body borrows its definition from a different node

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 01/13/2020 07:05:42
`@Fandykun` yes of course, Webots can easily simulate many robots (this will of course have an impact on the simulation speed, but if your computer is powerful enough this shouldn't be a problem).


`@Dr. Sudip Chakraborty` not for robotic arm, but there is a step by step tutorial for a wheeled robot: [https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/tutorial-6-4-wheels-robot](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/tutorial-6-4-wheels-robot)

Creatign a robotic arm is very similar (excepte that your joint should be serial).


`@sunnyjerai` the DEF should be defined inside the PROTO file, is it the case ?


`@sajid`, this is not a trivial task but you can use a Supervisor to parse the world and get the trajectory of the road. You might be interessted by this script that parses a webots world file to extract the position of the roads: [https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots/tree/master/resources/sumo\_exporter](https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots/tree/master/resources/sumo_exporter)

##### sunnyjerai 01/13/2020 14:57:53
Thank you `@David Mansolino`


Instead of using DEF string , I just copied the shape geometry from all those transforms. It worked. I later exported it as a proto node.

##### AlbusSong 01/13/2020 23:02:51

`@David Mansolino` Thanks David. I will try to reuse the code. However, this is not what we are looking for though. It would be great if we could find the displacement of the car from the centre of lane at any given point. For that, we were looking into using a supervisor as you also suggested. We are encountering few modelling challenges here. 

Is it possible to add a supervisor to the wheel of the car?

How to run the supervisor along with the car driver?

It would be great if you could help us with these challenges.



Thanks again for your suggestions in the right direction.

##### W.El-Badry 01/14/2020 14:19:39
Is there any step by step for doing a "step simulation" using Python? i.e. :

1. Send a command like speed and step.

2. Webots do a step (10 ms).

3. Sends back acknowledgment for step completion and wait for next step command.

##### Fabien Rohrer [Moderator] 01/14/2020 14:23:43
`@W.El-Badry`  This is certainly possible using the Supervisor API:

In Webots, the youbot controllers are using this library which offers helper functions to control the arm and the base. (basic IK, etc.)

##### nap 01/14/2020 14:40:45
Cool.  Does that library include facilities for a Kinect?

##### Fabien Rohrer [Moderator] 01/14/2020 14:41:16
No, but an interface with the Kinect can be directly done in the controller.


To be honest, the Kinect is not used in the tower of hanoi demo üôÇ


It is only enabled.

##### nap 01/14/2020 14:42:02
Ok, that's fine.  I suppose it's just a sequence of poses


Can the Youbot proto accept a Kinect?

##### Fabien Rohrer [Moderator] 01/14/2020 14:43:30
Yes, the arm is controlled by a sequence of predefined poses, except for the final approach where IK is used to move the arm down perfectly vertically. A local GPS (and Compass if I remember well) is used to move the robot at the correct location.


Yes, you can add the Kinect into the youBot slots.

What is/are the paths that Webots searches to populate the `controller` selection list?

##### Fabien Rohrer [Moderator] 01/14/2020 14:53:48
first, it checks the "controllers" directory of the current project, then, if the robot is a PROTO, the "controllers" directory of the proto source location.

##### nap 01/14/2020 14:54:28
But what if `worlds` and `controllers` are at the same level?

##### Fabien Rohrer [Moderator] 01/14/2020 14:55:31
Yes, Webots is strict about the sub-directories of the project directory.


a project directory could contain the "worlds", "controllers" and "protos" (and more) at the same level.


Here is some doc: [https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/the-standard-file-hierarchy-of-a-project](https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/the-standard-file-hierarchy-of-a-project)

##### Lifebinder (tsampazk) 01/14/2020 15:50:10
Hello there! Quick question: In the UI i can see 3 kinds of velocities for a Solid (absolute, and 2 relative), is there a way to get the relative one's in code? Which one does the getVelocity() method return? ( i'm working in python 3.7)

##### User21 01/14/2020 17:08:58
Hi :)

I want to use MoveIt with Webots and I want to set a Goal for my Endeffector as a Function in Webots. I tried it with the MoveGroup Commander but my controller crashes everytime when i want to use the command.

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 01/15/2020 06:57:54
`@User21` hi, with which robot are you using MoveIt and with ROS1 or ROS2 ? And which controller are you using (the default ros controller?)? I don't know the MoveGroup Commander but we have successfully used MoveIt in RViz to control the UR5e robot in Webots.


`@PA` , I am sorry but this chat is in english only.


`@Lifebinder (tsampazk)` the getVelocity function returns the absolute velocity (thank you for pointing this out, we will make this clearer in the doc), if you want to get relative velocities you simply have to get the velocity of the other solid too and compute the difference.

##### sajid 01/15/2020 09:20:16
Hi all,

Quick question. Is there a matlab support for 'driver' library (mainly for cars, e.g. using in city.wbt)? 

Is there any more dependencies we should consider when calling C functions from Matlab for the driver library?

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 01/15/2020 09:23:17
`@sajid` we currently don't have any matlab interface for the driver API, however, the dependencies are exactly the same as for libcontroller.

##### User21 01/15/2020 09:23:30
`@David Mansolino`  i am using the universal robot ur5e with ros melodic. im using the universal ros controller and added code to define the endeffector goal.

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 01/15/2020 11:49:14
`@User21`, ok then you are in a very similar setup to the known working one, that's good. When the controller crashes, do you have any stack displayed?


`@sajid` why would you need to add the supervisor specifically to the wheel ? Can't you just pu tthe supervisor at the root of the tree and get the wheel from the supervisor?

You can either transform the car itself in a supervisor (by setting the `supervisor` to true) either add an independant supervisor that will communicate with your vehicle using emitter-receiver.

If you are interested Cyberbotics provide professionnal consulting and can send you an offer for developing this for you.

##### LaCava 01/15/2020 14:31:26
Hi -- apologies for this incredibly simple question (\_very\_ new to Webots), but when a Robot has its Supervisor attribute set to TRUE, how are those functions actually invoked (say, within a controller)?



After reading the docs, I was under the impression that I could call them as if they were Robot functions inside my controller, but this doesn't appear to be the case, unless I've gone off the rails in my understanding/setup.



The controller itself is simple, I've got a robot class containing a few basic initialization functions, and a run function that accepts keyboard input to change LED colors (advanced robotics, I know). My goal was to map some supervisor functions to keypresses as well, just to see it 'working' - but this is met with AttributeErrors, since the class doesn't actually \_have\_ those functions.



Outwith the class, the robot is instantiated and its run() function invoked. Like I said, it's quite barebones.

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 01/15/2020 14:32:30
Which programming language do you use?

##### LaCava 01/15/2020 14:32:33
Python

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 01/15/2020 14:32:58
Then you should derivate your controller class from Supervisor instead of deriving it from Robot.


(see the driver.py example in Webots/projects/languages/python/controller/driver/driver.py)

##### LaCava 01/15/2020 14:34:27
Ah, thanks! I'll take a look, much appreciated.


Knew it had to be something simple

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 01/15/2020 14:34:41
Supervisor is a super-class of Robot and hence expose all the Robot API + the Supervisor API.

##### LaCava 01/15/2020 14:37:25
All good now, thanks again.

##### DrVoodoo [Moderator] 01/15/2020 15:30:37
Is anyone able to help with a question regarding proto files? I've got a proto defines a Car and then additional aspects of the design as declared within the extensionSlot (body shell geometry etc)


*are declared


We got various possible configurations of sensors that can be stuck on this base chassis (let's call it BaseChassis.proto)


So I've another proto that defines a BaseChassis and then I want to be able to add to the extensionSlot of the Car

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 01/15/2020 15:34:31
Hi `@DrVoodoo`

##### DrVoodoo [Moderator] 01/15/2020 15:34:38
Let's call this new proto ACar


Hi `@David Mansolino`


I can add an extensionSlot field to ACar (field MFNode     extensionSlot   [])


but I can't append the contents of that to extensionSlot of the Car, all I can do is override it

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 01/15/2020 15:38:54
Ok, the solution is quite simple, if you want to extend and not override you have to create something like this in BaseChassis.proto:

```
...
    extensionSlot [
      Group {
        children IS extensionSlot
      }
      other nodes...
    ]
```

Does this answer your question (I am not 100% sure to understand the problem)?

##### DrVoodoo [Moderator] 01/15/2020 15:39:51
`@David Mansolino` you've definitely understood that I'm trying to achieve


but if I try that approach is get an error


specifically "error: Derived and base PROTO can use the same parameter name only if it is linked directly, like 'extensionSlot IS extensionSlot'."

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 01/15/2020 15:42:14
Ok yes I forgot this rule, in that case you simply have to use another name for your field in BaseChassis.proto, such as:

```
...
    extensionSlot [
      Group {
        children IS baseChassisExtension
      }
      other nodes...
    ]
...
```

##### DrVoodoo [Moderator] 01/15/2020 15:43:47
Ok, so I have got to rename it? I have also been trying to use the lua template syntax to insert the contents of the field into the existing extensionSlot definition but my lua is non-existant

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 01/15/2020 15:44:41
Yes, simply renaming it in your BaseChassis.proto should fix the problem. You can do this with lua too indeed, but that's more complicated

##### DrVoodoo [Moderator] 01/15/2020 15:45:10
In effect something like 
```extensionSlot [ 
  %{= fields.extensionSlot.value }%
```


Ok, thanks

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 01/15/2020 15:48:11
Unfortunately that's not so simple, Node arguments are not simply translated into strings but into a dictionnary (that you have to parse if you want to use it: [https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/procedural-proto-nodes#programming-facts](https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/procedural-proto-nodes#programming-facts))


You're welcome

##### DrVoodoo [Moderator] 01/15/2020 15:51:58
So technically possible but definitely not worth the hassle. Thanks for the help, I'll stick with the rename

##### vinay 01/16/2020 16:38:41
hello everyone


we are actually making bot for robocon events so,we want a good compass sensor do anyone help which is better to use

##### Fabien Rohrer [Moderator] 01/16/2020 16:41:45
Webots contains a Compass sensor out of the box.


Please refer to:


- the Compass node doc: [https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/compass](https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/compass)


- this example: [https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/samples-devices#compass-wbt](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/samples-devices#compass-wbt)

##### vinay 01/16/2020 16:44:34
but there are no details about sensor model?

##### Fabien Rohrer [Moderator] 01/16/2020 16:46:21
mmm... the reference manual link mentioned above gives a lot of information about this model, doesn't it? Do you refer about something in particular?

##### vinay 01/16/2020 16:47:39
but i am actually asking about the particular model for good performance

##### Fabien Rohrer [Moderator] 01/16/2020 16:50:39
Could you give an example of "particular model"?


The Compass is very basic, it only indicates the direction of the WorldInfo.northDirection vector. A white noise can be added using the lookupTable. Compass doesn't deal with anything else, such as electromagnetic field, etc.

##### User21 01/16/2020 17:30:40

##### bsr.nur.bahadir 01/16/2020 23:12:54
Hi I'm trying to learn Webots with the tutorials but sometimes it shuts down itself without any reason when I try to add objects or start the simulation. How can I solve this problem?

##### sujit 01/17/2020 04:10:58
O just discovered webots aftre years stuck with physics mods in sketchup its AN


AMAZING!!


does any


one hsve a spot mini model?

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 01/17/2020 06:58:37
`@User21` of good news, thank you for the feedback !


`@bsr.nur.bahadir`, do you experience this with one specific simulation? Or when adding one specific object? On which OS are you and are you using the latest version of Webots?

In any case, make sure that your GPU drivers are up to date.


`@sujit`, welcome to Webots!

Unfortunately we don't have a spot mini model yet, but you can create one yourself, here is a tutorial for creating a simple robot model: [https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/tutorial-6-4-wheels-robot](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/tutorial-6-4-wheels-robot)

And then to create a PROTO from it: [https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/tutorial-7-your-first-proto](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/tutorial-7-your-first-proto)


`@sujit` if you want Cyberbotics provide professional consulting and can create the model for you.

##### Angerbot 01/17/2020 13:19:33
Hi `@michou214` Im not yet able to download the software to use. Does Webots allow import of third-party platforms such as Fusion 360? Is it also possible to input code that will, for instance simulate readings from an optical encoder then potentially execute new joint-movement from input corrections?What is the compatibility with arduino and possibility to form movement and automatically generate code for arduino IDE?


Appreciate!

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 01/17/2020 13:31:39
Hi `@Angerbot` You can download Webots from here: [https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots/releases/tag/R2020a-rev1](https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots/releases/tag/R2020a-rev1)


From fusion 360 you should export your model into VRML format, this format can then be imported into Webots.


Yes of course you can use the position-sensor device to read a joint angle and then use the motor API to control the joint


There is no interface for arduino but as arduino support C language and Webots too it should be quite simple to go from one to the other.


We strongly recommend to use the Webots tutorial to get familiar with Webots: [https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/tutorials](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/tutorials)

I am using python as the language for my controllers

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 01/17/2020 14:12:29
Hello `@sunnyjerai` , as any other sensors you have to activate it, then you can use the `getRollPitchYaw` fucntion which will return you an array with three components representing (in this order) the roll, the pitch and the yaw.

##### e-puck 01/17/2020 15:52:57
Hello, I'm currently working with e-pucks in Webots. I'm struggling with synchronizing the e-pucks (they should wait for all pucks to finish moving before beginning a new cycle (cycle is look-compute-move)). I'm currently doing this by allocating e-pucks a max number of timesteps, when e-pucks finish before the max number of timesteps, they wait. This methods works but causes very very long simulations. Would anyone know of a better solution?

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 01/17/2020 15:56:33
Hi e-puck, you can use amitter-receiver devices for example to broadcast a message when the epuck finish its task, when all the e-pucks are broadcasting it means they have all finished.


But of course other solutions exist (but this is probably the simplest one).

##### e-puck 01/17/2020 15:59:14
Thank you very much for the quick response, I will try to implement that now

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 01/18/2020 11:07:38
No, there is no such a thing in Webots. You can however adjust the friction parameters to make the contact properties as close as possible as if it was sand, but I am not sure how realistic that could be.

##### DrVoodoo [Moderator] 01/18/2020 20:07:24
`@Lifebinder (tsampazk)` is it purely that the noise is an issue? You can turn the amplitude down to 0

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 01/20/2020 06:54:48
`@bsr.nur.bahadir`, you're welcome. About the jpg issue, which version of Webots are you using, and on which OS?


`@sunnyjerai` you're welcome!


`@Lifebinder (tsampazk)` you can find the exact same worlds in Webots in 'projects/samples/robotbenchmark': [https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots/tree/master/projects/samples/robotbenchmark](https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots/tree/master/projects/samples/robotbenchmark)

##### bsr.nur.bahadir 01/20/2020 09:50:25
`@David Mansolino` I'm using lastest version of Webots on Windows. I actually don't know too much these things but when I run Webots with Nvidia's gpu it's having jpg issue but if I use Intel's this time program generally shuts down itself.

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 01/20/2020 09:53:02
`@bsr.nur.bahadir` using the Nvidia GPU is indeed a better idea to run Webots ;-)

Please make sure:

  1. to update your GPU drivers.

  2. that your `PATH` environment variable is clean (it is for example possible that a conflicting version of the jpeg library is in your path).

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 01/20/2020 11:21:05
`@Dorteel` good news !


`@bsr.nur.bahadir` ok, this definitely means that you have one library installed on your computer that is causing conflicts with the jpeg library used by Webots, unfortunately it is very difficult for me to say where this library can be located.

But you set supervisor to True on your robot and you get access to the god mode functions, including rest sim

Are you using the latest version of Webots (we fixed some issues with the reset in R2020a).

##### Gautier A. 01/21/2020 13:14:16
Hello !


I have a problem : I try to get the value of a field (the "rotation" field)  from a proto. It doesn't works when the node is a proto (but it does works when that proto is converted to base node).


What I mean by "It doesn't works" is that I have to save the simulation and reset it for the value to be actualized

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 01/21/2020 13:18:32
Hi `@Gautier A.`, do you have a simple example / procedure to share?

##### Gautier A. 01/21/2020 13:24:13
Sure, here is the corresponding code I use :


Node * reaction = supervisor->getSelf();

  double rotation[4] = {0,0,0,0};

  double * tempo;    

  Field * rotationField = reaction->getField("rotation");



    tempo = (double *) rotationField->getSFRotation();

    rotation[0] = tempo[0];

    rotation[1] = tempo[1];

    rotation[2] = tempo[2];

    rotation[3] = tempo[3];

    

    std::cout<<"Current rotation ! "<<rotation[0]<<" "<<rotation[1]<<" "<<rotation[2]<<" "<<rotation[3]<<" "<<std::endl<<std::endl;


for the supervisor


The proto is a generic proto, with  just "rotation IS rotation" and "    field SFRotation rotation               0 1 0 0                   # Is `Transform.rotation`."

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 01/21/2020 13:26:24
Ok, I will try it soon


thank you


`@Gautier A.` I juste tried with this controller and world and I can't reproduce the issue:

It has a one step delay between the value displayed in the scene-tree and the one in the console but this is normal. Can you reproduce the same bahavior too?

##### Gautier A. 01/21/2020 14:22:06
`@David Mansolino`  Thank you for your response


I tried your file and your world, it does work


I've tried to replicate the bug with "default/box" protos, but I wasn't able to replicate it. It seems to not works when it's a proto which has another proto has a children


I've made a video that shows the behavior : [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Ex\_tqCoKFI&feature=youtu.be](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Ex_tqCoKFI&feature=youtu.be) One world works, one world doesn't. Both world have the same proto with the same controller, but in one, it's the children of a proto, and in the other the children of a robot

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 01/21/2020 14:29:55
Ok thank you for the precision, I will try to reproduce this.

##### DrVoodoo [Moderator] 01/21/2020 14:31:02
`@moustachemartin`  it sounds like the arm is interacting with the box. Is the box moving at all?


Have you set the contactmaterial parameter?

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 01/21/2020 14:34:27
`@Gautier A.` ok I can reproduce with this slightly modified version of the sample: [https://gist.github.com/DavidMansolino/a2006549cb834f312b9ebdb830006764](https://gist.github.com/DavidMansolino/a2006549cb834f312b9ebdb830006764)

##### Gautier A. 01/21/2020 14:41:19
`@David Mansolino` yes, that's the bug !


Do you have any idea where it can come from ?

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 01/21/2020 14:42:10
Unfortunately no, But I will open a bug report and we will try to fix this as soon as possible.

##### Angerbot 01/21/2020 14:57:31
Hi `@David Mansolino`, thanks for the platform - really great. Im running lower requirement GPU (2012 Mac Pro/12GB RAM). Application seems to lag quite abit. Any advice? Thanks

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 01/21/2020 14:59:43
`@Gautier A.` this is now done here (any progress will be posted on the issue): [https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots/issues/1290](https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots/issues/1290)


`@Angerbot` you're welcome, happy to see you like it.

What is your GPU? Make sure that the drivers are up to date.

In the worse case you can disable some of the OpenGL feature: [https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/preferences#opengl](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/preferences#opengl)

For example disabling the 'Ambient Occlusion' might help quite a lot on low-end GPU.

You might find other tips too here: [https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/speed-performance](https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/speed-performance)

##### Angerbot 01/21/2020 15:03:24
It is a ATI Radeon HD 5870 im sure - sounds right. I will give the above a go! thanks !

##### Luiz Felipe 01/22/2020 05:32:55
Hello. I am running webots on windows with a 1080Ti gpu and with a 1060Ti gpu. In both of them for my environment the speed is around 0.5x. When i run the same environment in linux with the 1080Ti I get around 0.9-1x speed. This problem is related with the nvidia drivers for windows?

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 01/22/2020 07:03:56
Yes that may be an explanation, we have noticed such kind of performance difference across OS (in one way or the other) too. Make sure that your GPU drivers are up to date on Windows.

##### Dorteel 01/22/2020 08:23:55
Hi guys! I'm trying to set the built-in TurtleBot 3 Burger's linear velocity to match the real TurtleBot 3 Burger's maximum linear velocity of 0.22 m/s (as specified here: [http://emanual.robotis.com/docs/en/platform/turtlebot3/specifications/](http://emanual.robotis.com/docs/en/platform/turtlebot3/specifications/)), but I run into a warning, saying that the maxVelocity is set to 2.84 rad/sec (which in this case with 0.033m wheel radius would be around 0.09 m/s) and I can't exceed that. Is there a way to change that maximum velocity?

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 01/22/2020 08:32:55
Hi `@Dorteel` let me check this


It seems indeed that there is an issue, the 'Maximum rotational velocity' was used to compute the maximum wheel speed instead of the 'Maximum translational velocity'.


May I ask you to test with this patched version or the PROTO ?
> **Attachment**: [TurtleBot3Burger.proto](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/565154703139405824/669461393984061470/TurtleBot3Burger.proto)

##### Dorteel 01/22/2020 08:40:35
ah, yeah, that makes perfect sense. I knew the 2.84 was familiar üòÑ

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 01/22/2020 08:45:46
I am fixing this for the next version of Webots: [https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots/pull/1294](https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots/pull/1294)

##### Dorteel 01/22/2020 08:47:23
Thank you very much `@David Mansolino` ! Solved the issue perfectly!

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 01/22/2020 08:47:47
Perfect, thank you for the feedback !

##### yunus [Moderator] 01/23/2020 05:32:59
Hello. I am using **rospy **in Webots to communicate with Simulink. I added a GPS device to my Khepera robot by adding it as node in the TurretSlot field in the scene tree. In the controller, I have enabled GPS like this:

`mygps = robot.getGPS('gps')`

`mygps.enable(timeStep)`

`......`

`GPSpub = rospy.Publisher('mygps',Vector3, queue_size=10)`

and inside the control loop, I added a line"

`GPSpub.publish(mygps.getValues())`



The error I get is in the control loop, and the useful info in it says:

`.............

Invalid number of arguments, args should be ['x', 'y', 'z'] args are([-0.01999999987308264, -0.00011893769370018015, -0.125],)

............`

PS: Those three numerical value above are the exact GPS location, so I know at least that it reads them, but I think it's not correctly formatted. Thank you for pointing to me the mistake.

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 01/23/2020 06:57:10
Hi `@yunus`, this is indeed a format issue. Your are almost correct, the only issue is that mygps.getValues() returns an array and not a Vector3, here is a more correct version:

```
mygps = robot.getGPS('gps')
mygps.enable(timeStep)
...
GPSpub = rospy.Publisher('mygps',Vector3, queue_size=10)
...
# in the control loop
gpsValues = mygps.getValues()
GPSpub.publish(Vector3(x=gpsValues[0], y=gpsValues[1], z=gpsValues[2]))
```

##### Dorteel 01/23/2020 09:04:06
Hi guys! Referring to my earlier problem with the angular and linear velocity of the TurtleBot 3 Burger, I've noticed that the maxVelocity is set to 6.66 rad/sec corresponding to the maximum linear velocity of 0.22 m/s of the real robot.


However if I set the motors to both the maximum linear and angular velocity, then the maxVelocity should be around 12.65 if I'm not mistaken

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 01/23/2020 09:05:47
You mean if the robot is going at the maximum forward speed and rotating in the same time?

##### Dorteel 01/23/2020 09:08:13
if I'm setting linear and angular velocities  to the max in ROS, then I should get the maximum velocity of a wheel corresponding to 12.64 rad/sec. Using the model in the screenshot

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 01/23/2020 09:09:17
I am sorry but from the datasheets of the motor ([http://emanual.robotis.com/docs/en/dxl/x/xl430-w250/](http://emanual.robotis.com/docs/en/dxl/x/xl430-w250/)) it say maximum speed is 61 [rev/min] which is way lower than  12.64 rad/sec.

##### Dorteel 01/23/2020 09:10:20
ah I see. So it's actually physically not possible to have both of them set to the max a the same time, right?

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 01/23/2020 09:10:45
Yes it seems indeed.

##### Dorteel 01/23/2020 09:12:11
Great, that clears things up! Thanks once again!

You're welcome

##### JC 01/23/2020 16:53:50
Hi, cant quite seem to initialise the supervisor in python, i really feel like im missing something simple.


i use supervisor = Supervisor(robot)


and get the error


TypeError: \_\_init\_\_() takes 1 positional argument but 2 were given

##### Fabien Rohrer [Moderator] 01/23/2020 16:54:50
Try:


> supervisor = Supervisor()


üòâ

##### JC 01/23/2020 16:56:07
i tried that and got:


Only one instance of the Robot class should be created


as an error

##### Fabien Rohrer [Moderator] 01/23/2020 16:56:25
Ok, please do not create a Robot() instance then.


All the robot API is accessible from a Supervisor instance.


Typically:


> supervisor = Supervisor()

> ds = supervisor.getDistanceSensor('ds')  # Robot API example

> node = supervisor.getSelf()  # Supervisor API example

##### JC 01/23/2020 16:59:13
oh i see, i thought of it like an add on to an existing robot but its more like a robot instance with more functionality

##### Fabien Rohrer [Moderator] 01/23/2020 16:59:41
yes, exactly.


Supervisor is a subclass of Robot.

##### JC 01/23/2020 16:59:58
fantastic, thanks for your help

##### Shadow 01/23/2020 18:53:26
I was wondering if you can use css animations in a robot window? I can't seem to be able to get it to work

`@Shadow` on which OS are you (Webots does not use the same web engine on linux and mac or Windows) ?

##### Shadow 01/24/2020 08:18:16
`@David Mansolino` currently using windows

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 01/24/2020 11:30:23

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 01/24/2020 11:50:30
Yes of course


What is exactly the problem you have?

##### zibz 01/24/2020 11:50:47
ok, so I could attach a device cam to a display

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 01/24/2020 11:51:04
Yes of course

##### zibz 01/24/2020 11:51:39
but I dont seem to be able to get any data with cam.getImage() or cam.getImageArray()


its enabled


any debug tips?

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 01/24/2020 11:53:23
You don't need to get the actual data, you can simply use the 'Display.attachCamera' function ([https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/display#wb\_display\_attach\_camera](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/display#wb_display_attach_camera))

##### zibz 01/24/2020 11:53:56
It doesn't seem to have recognition capability

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 01/24/2020 11:54:10
Do you mean `cam.getImage()` is returning None?

##### zibz 01/24/2020 11:54:12

image = self.camera.getImageArray()



        #display the components of each pixel

                red = image[x][y][0]

                green = image[x][y][1]

                blue = image[x][y][2]

                gray = (red + green + blue) / 3

                print('r='+str(red)+' g='+str(green)+' b='+str(blue))


subscripting NoneType Object


that's the correct object reference

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 01/24/2020 12:00:48
How did you enable the camera? Did you call the robot.step function before ?

##### zibz 01/24/2020 12:01:34
it's enabled and attached to display, can see rendered images

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 01/24/2020 12:02:19
Did you call the robot.step function BEFORE the first for?

##### zibz 01/24/2020 12:02:46
no

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 01/24/2020 12:03:19
This is required because the image is updated only at the step (before it is None).

##### zibz 01/24/2020 12:03:35
kay, spot on probably


thx

ok, thanks

##### DrVoodoo [Moderator] 01/24/2020 13:00:24
How you process an image world depends on what it is that you're trying to do. When you say image recognition do you mean using the webots  recognition feature or something else?

##### zibz 01/24/2020 13:19:04
am trying to use features of a Recognition node


with the camera


so to distinguish objects in world


don't seem to have such node


hence was trying to understand what would the best approach be to have such feature on a controller


that's the context

##### DrVoodoo [Moderator] 01/24/2020 13:23:52
`@zibz` you need to have your camera node in your PROTO file and then you need to set up the recognition field e.g.

##### zibz 01/24/2020 13:24:49
kay, done that, gonna fiddle with it

##### DrVoodoo [Moderator] 01/24/2020 13:25:08

thank you for replies

##### DrVoodoo [Moderator] 01/24/2020 13:25:54
in your control code you've got to enable the recogniser seperately

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 01/24/2020 13:30:51
`@Ross` in that cas I strongly recommend to start with the official tutorial (at least 1 to 6): [https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/tutorials](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/tutorials)

They are not strictly related to Lidar, but will give you a good overview of how Webots works and how to use the various sensors of Webots.


Then if you have any specific question about Lidar do not hesitate to ask.

Is there a way to keep e-pucks connected via Wi-Fi when reloading the world or resetting the simulation? Or alternatively, to automatically reconnect them? (Background: We had some student teams working on shape formation algorithms with many e-pucks, and while debugging the controller they had to reconnect to all the e-pucks every time they wanted to change something in the controller and reload, which really takes a lot of time...)

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 01/24/2020 13:36:36
Hi `@Willem3141` not as I now, but you can automatically start the remote control mode when you start the controller with this function: `wb_robot_set_mode` ([https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/robot#wb\_robot\_get\_mode](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/robot#wb_robot_get_mode))

how can I download it?

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 01/25/2020 07:21:45
Hi `@FB`, you can download the latest version of Webots from here: [https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots/releases/tag/R2020a-rev1](https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots/releases/tag/R2020a-rev1)

`@ƒ∞chigogo`, it is not 'extend' but 'extern'


Hi `@enescan`  you can export your robot in VRML from SolidWorks and then import this VRML file in Webots directly (not that this will import only the shapes, you will then have to add solids, bounding objects, physics, sensors, etc.). Or import from SolidWorks to Blender and then Blender to Webots, here is an example with Autodesk Inventor  (Solidworks works similarly): [https://youtu.be/L0FVsFD2rS4](https://youtu.be/L0FVsFD2rS4)

Hey everyone! Im a developer trying to use the software to make a simulation of a 3d printing factory. I began using the UR5e model to start. But quickly realize it would be tricky since I do not have the linear sliders available, so I am trying to go with the kuka youbot. However, I will need to stack printers on top of each other (they are big 1m¬≥). So I wanted to get the opinion of someone regarding what could be a quicker fix to have a mobile robot managing a matrix of 3 x 3 x3 printers ?

##### Fabien Rohrer [Moderator] 01/27/2020 11:01:24
You can easily mount your UR5e arm on a linear slider. To do so, just add a Robot node with a SliderJoint, and mount your arm as a children of this node.

##### Mic.lop 01/27/2020 12:06:16

Hi, how I can register in webots 8.2.1&


?

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 01/29/2020 13:55:41
Hi `@Daniil` , you don't need to register anymore. Webots is free now, you simply have to set any email you want and use 'webots' as password

##### Daniil 01/29/2020 13:57:34
thanks, but the programm requires license


what should I do?

##### Dorteel 01/29/2020 13:57:52
Hi guys! I have a question regarding the TurtleBot 3  motor acceleration. Is it set to Infinite? Can't see it in the proto file.

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 01/29/2020 13:58:25
`@Daniil` it does not anymore, as license you just have to but webots@cyberbotics.com and use 'webots' as password

##### Dorteel 01/29/2020 13:58:54
I'm wondering if the robot has any momentum we should account for. If we're moving backwards  with max speed and the next velocity command is moving forward with max speed, do we just move forward with max speed in the next timestep? Or is there some momentum involved?

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 01/29/2020 13:59:09
`@Dorteel` yes indeed the acceleration was not calibrated and is therefore set to infinity for now.


The robot itself has some inertia, but on the motor side the wheel instantaneously rotate at the desired speed. It would be nice to valibrate this, but I don't have access to the real robot to test this yet.

##### Dorteel 01/29/2020 14:01:30
`@David Mansolino` Great to know! Thank you very much for the answer!

##### nelsondmmg 01/29/2020 14:25:05
Hi, I have a question concerning some of the available parameters for the vehicle. What does wheel damping constant stands for? This means that the tire is modeled in the longitudinal sense as a damper? Is there a defined value for the cornering stiffness for the Tesla model 3? Thanks


*longitudinal direction, sorry

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 01/29/2020 14:30:47
Hi `@nelsondmmg` the wheelsDampingConstant field of the car proto defines the friction parameter of the wheels joint, it is used to simulate the friction that slow down the vehicle.


`@Daniil` simply open one of the worlds in the WEBOTS\_HOME/projects/robots/softbank/nao folder: [https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/nao](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/nao)

##### nelsondmmg 01/29/2020 14:33:12
So there is not any slippage considered in the dynamic model?

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 01/29/2020 14:34:29
Yes, but the properties of the contact between the wheel and the ground are defined in the WorldInfo.contactProperties field: [https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/contactproperties](https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/contactproperties)

##### nelsondmmg 01/29/2020 14:35:19

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 01/29/2020 15:52:42
Here it is: [https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots/blob/master/src/lib/Controller/api/motor.c#L545](https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots/blob/master/src/lib/Controller/api/motor.c#L545)


And in case you are interested, here is the relation on the Webots side: [https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots/blob/master/src/webots/nodes/WbMotor.cpp#L445](https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots/blob/master/src/webots/nodes/WbMotor.cpp#L445)

##### nelsondmmg 01/29/2020 15:59:38
Thanks, but I'm looking for the file that really applies the torque using the dynamic vehicle equations


How each physical parameter for each type of vehicle are taken into account?

The answer to this question is complicated and lies basically in Webots side file indicated by `@David Mansolino`.

##### Panos 01/30/2020 10:08:01
Hi, I have attached a pair of glasses on the pedestrian model, which I want to work as a camera. I am trying to enable the camera in the pedestrian controller (python) but the camera overlay remains black. Can you help me with this?

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 01/30/2020 10:23:40
Hi Panos, did you enable the camera from a controller program?

##### Panos 01/30/2020 10:31:41
Hi Olivier, thanks for you reply. Yes, I added  "class Mycamera (Camera):" and then "def enable(self, samplingPeriod):" and "self.SamplingPeriod = 1"

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 01/30/2020 10:35:44
Ok, then are you sure there is no object in front of the camera occluding its field of view?


I would suggest you to start from a working camera example (for example in projects/samples/devices/worlds/camera.wbt) and modify it by importing your pedestrian model and you will likely find why the camera doesn't work as expected.

##### Panos 01/30/2020 10:45:42
Ok, I will try this. Thanks for your help!

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 01/31/2020 06:21:03
Hi `@LISC`, Webots is now free and open-source, we had therefore to change the login system of the older version to make it free for everyone. You simply need to use 'webots' as password.

Running WeBots on Mac and using Python 3.7 I get the following error:

`import \_controller  ImportError: dlopen(/Applications/Webots.app/lib/controller/python37/\_controller.so, 2): 

Library not loaded: /Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.7/Python

Python 3.7 is available on the system but is not located at the path above i.e. /Library/Frameworks/Python.framework ... That path does not exist.



Should I install Python from the Python website or what is expected to use the Webots python libraries?


Not entirely sure what is going on, but looking at the Webots source it is built against the python version living in /Library/Frameworks/Python.framework, which seems to not be recommended in newer MacOS versions. Most people recommend to remove that python directory if it is there, and on MacOS Catalina the folder does not exist.

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 02/03/2020 06:44:04
`@MohammadSorush` you can find some information in the dataseets of the device (e.g. [http://emanual.robotis.com/docs/en/dxl/mx/mx-64/](http://emanual.robotis.com/docs/en/dxl/mx/mx-64/)).

However, some of these parameters depends on the configuration of your robot (i.e. to what is connected the device) and not only the motor itself.


Hi `@w3. eydi` Welcome üòâ


`@shivajitheboss`, unfortunately we don't have any way of transferrign to arduino out of the box. But since both Webots and arduino support C like language it should be quite easy to adapt your code from one to the other.


`@SimonDK` how did you installed Python? Make sure to not use Python from brew or other, Webots will work only with the one downloaded on python.org. See this related post: [https://stackoverflow.com/questions/59840278/running-an-external-python-controller-from-console](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/59840278/running-an-external-python-controller-from-console)

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 02/03/2020 07:31:01
`@vinay`: your question doesn't seem to be related with Webots, it looks like a hardware question. I am sorry we can't help you on that.

`@Fabien Rohrer`  just updated the dependencies to the new 2020a libs and the error still happens. I'm using the same wbt file and the error still happens

##### MohammadSorush 02/03/2020 07:43:42
`@David Mansolino` none of the parameters that i mentioned, exist in this link could you help me how did you find out these parameters for MX-28?  Pleaaaase üòû

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 02/03/2020 07:44:41
`@MohammadSorush` not as is but they can be computed, for example it is easy to compute `maxVelocity` from speed: 63 [rev/min]

##### Fabien Rohrer [Moderator] 02/03/2020 07:45:12
`@nelsondmmg` Updated the dependencies? do you have a local copy of libController? It seems that you are not using the correct version, because line 54 is on line 52 here [https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots/blob/R2020a/src/lib/Controller/api/abstract\_camera.c#L54](https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots/blob/R2020a/src/lib/Controller/api/abstract_camera.c#L54) üòâ Please check how libController is linked and update the shared library.

Hello, I would like to know if that's possible to change the value of a custom field of a proto using lua in procedural protos nodes ?

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 02/03/2020 10:51:10
Hi `@Gautier A.` you mean you want a procedural PROTO to change the value of its own field visible in the scene tree or change the value of one of its internal fields?

##### Gautier A. 02/03/2020 10:52:18
Hi David, I would like it to change the value of its own field, visible in the scene tree (the value we access through "fields.variableName.value")

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 02/03/2020 10:53:11
You can change the `fields.variableName.value` value, but unfortunately this will not be visible in the scene-tree (this possibility is not yet implemented).

##### Gautier A. 02/03/2020 10:53:47
But the change will be taken "into account" when the proto is being generated ?

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 02/03/2020 10:54:16
For this iteration yes, but not for the next regeneration.

##### Gautier A. 02/03/2020 10:54:36
Basically, I want to use a lua library to load a config file when the proto is being loaded, but I want the user to be able to modify its value later


Oh, I see


Thank you

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 02/03/2020 13:32:58
Thank it may indeed come from the libcontroller (even if we are regularly checking for memory leaks). Would it be possible for you to use the development environment of Webots to recompile webots in debug mode in order to try to get more information on where exactly is the leak? (I can send you the procedure).

##### Gautier A. 02/03/2020 13:34:49

Hello everyone, I am working on simulation UR5e + robotiq 2 finger 85 gripper  with ROS controller. I can connect ur5 with ros in webots. But I have no idea how to control gripper with ROS. The gripper is supposed to be controlled through FollowJointTrajectoryAction. Is anyone have ideas how to do it?

##### Tahir [Moderator] 02/03/2020 15:55:00
There is one Robotiq package in ROS have a look at that


This is an action server you have to write an action client which will talk to the server and get the job done


If you just go to Universal Robots ROS driver github pacakage you can find a couple of exaoles there


This can also be controllex with rqt trajectory planner


And there might be other options as well

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 02/03/2020 16:28:00
Hi `@rachel`, yes I have an idea, but I am currently online from my phone. I will answer you tomorrow morning from my computer.


Juste √† question, are you using ROS 1 or 2?

##### rachel 02/03/2020 16:30:15
ROS 1 with moveit


I try to run arm and gripper in two group like running gazebo. Thank you very much! `@David Mansolino`

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 02/04/2020 06:35:19
Hi again `@rachel`, for ROS1 our interface with the FollowJointTrajectory action is limited to the univrsal robot robots. It is implemented in this controller: [https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots/tree/master/projects/robots/universal\_robots/controllers/universal\_robots\_ros](https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots/tree/master/projects/robots/universal_robots/controllers/universal_robots_ros)

It should be quite easy to extend it to the gripper too. It is just a metter of adding the names of the gripper motors:

[https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots/blob/master/projects/robots/universal\_robots/controllers/universal\_robots\_ros/joint\_state\_publisher.py#L24](https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots/blob/master/projects/robots/universal_robots/controllers/universal_robots_ros/joint_state_publisher.py#L24)

##### rachel 02/04/2020 08:07:25
Hello `@David Mansolino`. Thank yo for your response. I will explain what I already did. According to robotiq 85 simulation in Gazebo [https://github.com/StanleyInnovation/robotiq\_85\_gripper/blob/master/robotiq\_85\_simulation/robotiq\_85\_gazebo/controller/gripper\_controller\_robotiq.yaml](https://github.com/StanleyInnovation/robotiq_85_gripper/blob/master/robotiq_85_simulation/robotiq_85_gazebo/controller/gripper_controller_robotiq.yaml) The gripper is only controlled by one joint "gripper\_finger1\_joint". So I added this joint in the file  [https://github.com/ipa-rwu/ur5\_2f\_webots/blob/master/controllers/universal\_robots\_ros/joint\_state\_publisher.py](https://github.com/ipa-rwu/ur5_2f_webots/blob/master/controllers/universal_robots_ros/joint_state_publisher.py) which is this file [https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots/blob/master/projects/robots/universal\_robots/controllers/universal\_robots\_ros/joint\_state\_publisher.py](https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots/blob/master/projects/robots/universal_robots/controllers/universal_robots_ros/joint_state_publisher.py). And I modify the file [https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots/blob/master/projects/robots/universal\_robots/controllers/universal\_robots\_ros/trajectory\_follower.py](https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots/blob/master/projects/robots/universal_robots/controllers/universal_robots_ros/trajectory_follower.py). You can find here [https://github.com/ipa-rwu/ur5\_2f\_webots/blob/master/controllers/universal\_robots\_ros/trajectory\_follower.py](https://github.com/ipa-rwu/ur5_2f_webots/blob/master/controllers/universal_robots_ros/trajectory_follower.py). Could you have look the file I modify? I am not so sure how to write FollowJointTrajectoryAction for gripper in Webots.

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 02/04/2020 08:47:18
We don't have the 85 model, only the 3F one: [https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/gripper-actuators#robotiq-3f-gripper](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/gripper-actuators#robotiq-3f-gripper)


You therefore have to create yourself the model. For this you can use our urdf importer: [https://github.com/cyberbotics/urdf2webots](https://github.com/cyberbotics/urdf2webots)


About the trajectory\_follower.py it is probabyl simpler to just add the name to the `jointNames` array

##### rachel 02/04/2020 08:55:59
`@David Mansolino` But if I just add joint in trajectory\_folloer.py so arm joints and gripper joint will all publish to topic /follow\_joint\_trajectory. I want use /arm\_control/follow\_joint\_trajectory for arm and /gripper\_contraol/follow\_joint\_trajectory


This the gripper I am using after convert from urdf [https://github.com/ipa-rwu/ur5\_2f\_webots/blob/master/protos/Robotiq85Gripper.proto](https://github.com/ipa-rwu/ur5_2f_webots/blob/master/protos/Robotiq85Gripper.proto)

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 02/04/2020 09:15:41
Nice to see that you have already the gripper model.

That makes sense indeed. What you deed seems correct (not tested, but I had an overview of the code). Do you have issues with it?

I have a question related to the graphical representation of objects on webots. I'm using the tesla model 3 robot, and when it drives onto the sidewalk the tire surpasses the vehicle's body (the suspension is pretty low). Is there a parameter that I can change to stop this from happening? Thanks

##### DrVoodoo [Moderator] 02/04/2020 15:53:08
`@nelsondmmg` the tesla model is using the Car proto so you could adjust the suspension damping values

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 02/04/2020 16:09:45
`@nelsondmmg`, `@DrVoodoo` is correct, the four main parameters that influences the suspensions are `suspensionFrontSpringConstant`, `suspensionFrontDampingConstant`, `suspensionRearSpringConstant` and `suspensionRearDampingConstant` the spring effect defines the magnitude of the spring force effect and the damping effect produce viscous friction, see the pages for more information:

##### kadeng 02/05/2020 06:46:15
Hi, I just accidentally stumbled upon Webots. Just to get a rough idea, how mature is Webots in comparison to Gazebo?

##### Fabien Rohrer [Moderator] 02/05/2020 06:52:09
`@kadeng` Difficult to have an impartial answer here, but Webots is much more mature IMO. Certainly because of its close source history (before being released open source).


We could try to provide you more precise answer on specific topics.


It has obvious advantages over Gazebo: it runs smoothly on Windows/macOS, it is deterministic, it provides a realistic rendering, its physics engine and collisions are better, it provides web streaming features, etc.

##### kadeng 02/05/2020 06:56:19
Well, I am currently trying to design a custom robot which also has an UR5 robotic arm attached for simulation in Gazebo. Installed the Phobos plugin in Blender and tried to get things working. But noticed that basically not much is working as documented, docs are bad and out of date, exceptions keep popping up. Then this morning I found webots..


Physical simulation accuracy is also important, since the robot is for a plugging task.

##### Fabien Rohrer [Moderator] 02/05/2020 06:57:53
We have an UR5 arm running out of the box: [https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/ure](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/ure)


It could be plugged in any other robot, or your own one.

##### kadeng 02/05/2020 06:59:16

`@nelsondmmg` they do represent the spring and damping effect that you can see in a real joint.


`@SimonDK` thank for the feedback. If you want to use another distribution of Python you can recompile the python wrapper for your specific distribution, here is the mekfaile that need to be adjusted: [https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots/blob/master/resources/languages/python/Makefile](https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots/blob/master/resources/languages/python/Makefile)

Hi `@Gautier A.` yes of course!

##### Gautier A. 02/05/2020 13:24:15
Hi `@David Mansolino`  !


So, my problem is that I want to access the children field of a proto. I have some other proto in the "children" field and I would like to retrieve their orientation/translation


I tried to put the children field as a "" visible field "" of the proto with some default argument, instantiating the other different proto, but that doesn't works because we use some lua to put their orientation/position

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 02/05/2020 13:29:58
You want to get the field using the supervisor API right?

##### Gautier A. 02/05/2020 13:30:17
Yes, that's right !

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 02/05/2020 13:30:55

In the meantime, I would recomment to convert your PROTO temporarly to base node, you can easily do this by right-clicking on your PROTO node and selecting `Convert to Base Node(s)`


And you can follow the progress of [https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots/issues/1310](https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots/issues/1310)

##### Gautier A. 02/05/2020 13:33:21
Ok, that's good new, thank you a lot !


Is there any way to convert automatically the proto in base node (through supervisor or other) ? We use a supervisor to instantiate the different proto at the beginning of the simulation, so we try to "minimize user input".

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 02/05/2020 13:35:59
Unfortunately this is not available through the Supervisor API.

##### Gautier A. 02/05/2020 13:37:38

Hallo, i want to use Webots and ROS on Mac. Has anyone actually got ROS working on Mac ?

##### Fabien Rohrer [Moderator] 02/06/2020 11:24:53
Hi,


If I'm not wrong, ROS itself cannot run on macOS. You should think about running it on linux. However, the ROS client which interfaces Webots and ROS can run on macOS. Therefore your simulation may run on macOS.

##### kwy 02/06/2020 11:28:21
Oh! that is perfect. so i need to download the ROS client?

##### Fabien Rohrer [Moderator] 02/06/2020 11:29:03
This should run out-of-the-box in Webots.


The client ROS controller is called "ros"


it can be run in every simulation (as it's a default controller):


[https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots/tree/master/projects/default/controllers/ros](https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots/tree/master/projects/default/controllers/ros)


You just need to set your Robot.controller field to "ros"

##### kwy 02/06/2020 11:33:10
ok.  when I create a simulation, i need to run ROS and Webots on Linux. after i finish the simulation,  then i can run the simulation directly on mac. Right?

##### Fabien Rohrer [Moderator] 02/06/2020 11:35:24
Yes, it seems to be possible. But in any case, the ROS node should run in Linux. But Webots can run on macOS.


You should use this parameter: ROS\_MASTER\_URI:


[https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/using-ros#using-the-standard-ros-controller](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/using-ros#using-the-standard-ros-controller)

##### yunus [Moderator] 02/06/2020 13:16:02
Hello. On the same subject of using ROS. I am trying to use ROS to communicate commands from MATLAB Simulink to a Khepera III in Webots. All is running on Windows 10. I used 'rospy' Python controller in Webots and it works, but there is at least 20 seconds latency between when I send the Simulink command and when the robot starts moving. So I am thinking of using 'ros' controller to get around this problem of asynchronous response (*as I think C codes are faster to compile than Python's*). However, when I open any sample world that uses 'ros', I get this error:

`WARNING: Robot: The controller directory has not been found, searched the following locations:

C:/Program Files/Webots/projects/languages/ros/controllers/ros/

C:/Program Files/Webots/projects/default/controllers/ros/

C:/Program Files/Webots/resources/projects/controllers/ros/`

Can you please give me some advice?

And what possibly you think is the reason why my Webots simulation doesn't run immediately as I press run on my Simulink simulation?

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 02/06/2020 13:22:24
Hi `@yunus` the ros controller is suppose to be in `C:/Program Files/Webots/projects/default/controllers/ros/` can't you see any ros.exe there? If not re-installing Webots might fix the problem.


About the reason of the delay, it is diffcult to say, because you have many conversion from one framework to the other. Webots->ROS->Simulink->Ros->Webots

##### kadeng 02/06/2020 13:30:21
I would recommend to use printf debugging (write a log files with timestamps) to isolate the delay.


Does anyone know if the source code of the standard ros controller for webots is open source? Seems like it is a precompiled library that is being downloaded via the Makefile


I was wondering whether it would be possible to get it to run on Windows (acting as a client to a Linux VM running ROS)

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 02/06/2020 13:43:38
HI `@kadeng` yes it is open source, the code is here: [https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots/tree/master/projects/default/controllers/ros](https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots/tree/master/projects/default/controllers/ros)

Abotu the Makefiles, you are probably refeering to: [https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots/blob/master/projects/default/libraries/Makefile](https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots/blob/master/projects/default/libraries/Makefile)

This makefiles only download the dependencies of the controller (libros.dll etc.),


> I was wondering whether it would be possible to get it to run on Windows (acting as a client to a Linux VM running ROS)

If you manage to recompile it for Windows (I did it a long time ago, but it is not working with the newer version of Webots), it should be possible indeed.

##### kadeng 02/06/2020 13:46:47
So the libros is part of ROS? If so, I can find it.

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 02/06/2020 13:48:08
(yes, I said libros, but it's probably not named like this, this was just an example)

##### kadeng 02/06/2020 13:48:09
I guess the normal Windows build of ROS will not work, due to different compilers etc. Or what do you think? Because I built ROS for Windows already, but ended up not using it..

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 02/06/2020 13:48:40
If it is build with GCC too it should work

##### kadeng 02/06/2020 13:48:55

`@David Mansolino` indeed there is no ros.exe in the entire C:\Program Files\Webots. Thank you very much for your advice, I will reinstall Webots and see.

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 02/07/2020 06:25:16
`@kadeng`, I just cheked and you are right, the Windows version of the ros controller is not available anymore because we have issues recompiling the  ros/rocpp\_core, roscpp and rosconsole with mingw64 (but this is for sure doable, we just hadn't time to do this).

However, on Windows you might use the python API to communicate with Webots from ROS: [https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/using-ros#custom-ros-controller](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/using-ros#custom-ros-controller)


Hi `@zibz` you can use any image processing library you want, here is how to integrate it in C/C++ for example: [https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/using-webots-makefiles#adding-an-external-library-ccp](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/using-webots-makefiles#adding-an-external-library-ccp)

##### yunus [Moderator] 02/07/2020 12:43:21
`@kadeng` yes, there is no ros.exe for Windows, I noticed that too. And as `@David Mansolino` pointed out. I am using that costum ros controller with rospy, and it works. Hopefully the roscpp will be complied for Windows and supported in future Webots releases.

##### kadeng 02/07/2020 13:12:58
@yunus: I tried the custom ros controller, but could not find a way to get rospy library for Windows. Where did you get it from?


@yunus: ping, given that I forgot to correctly @mention you before..

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 02/07/2020 13:45:20
`@kadeng`: it is distributed within Webots in: `projects/languages/ros/controllers/ros_python`


`@kadeng`: it is distributed within Webots in: `projects/languages/ros/controllers/ros_python`

##### yunus [Moderator] 02/07/2020 13:54:48
`@kadeng` The rospy library comes directly installed in Webots on this path `C:\Program Files\Webots\projects\languages\ros\controllers\ros_python`

If you go to Webots, Files > Open Sample World, then browse to: languages > ros > ros\_python.wbt you will see a sample world with a Thymio robot having a controller "ros\_python" that creates some ROS topics "motor" and "sensor". After you open that sample world, you should be able to see the sensor values being published on the Webots console. That's how you know ROS is working.


`@David Mansolino` thank you, I just realized you've answered the question before me üôÇ


Just as an additional remark: before rospy on Webots can work, I had first to install ROS for Windows using the steps on this link: [http://wiki.ros.org/Installation/Windows](http://wiki.ros.org/Installation/Windows), (the last step is to create that shortcut file that you will call "ROS", and when you type "roscore" in it, it should show you no error. This indicates that ROS has been correctly installed)

##### kadeng 02/07/2020 14:11:32
`@David Mansolino` BTW just to let you know. I gave up on building roscpp and related libraries in msys. This is probably a ton of work. You would have to either get catkin to run properly in msys (which requires *reverting* a lot of the special treatment for Windows. Or, most likely much easier, put all of the  sources into one big library and build a dll from it. The thing is, roscpp pulls in a lot of other ROS components.

##### kwy 02/07/2020 14:12:15

`@kwy` I have not yet used Webots on mac, but I am sure you must install ROS first before you can use "ros python". This is true for Windows, Linux and mac also.

We do not add it, because we want to be able to commit il, to make sure everyone uses the same layout, but it is not a bad practice to ignore it.

Alternatively, if you define the `WEBOTS_ALLOW_MODIFY_INSTALLATION` environment variable, Webots will not change the wbproj file: [https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots/blob/07d7ca6722139cec1415a7d3e308c298512b3124/src/install\_scripts/bashrc.linux#L12](https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots/blob/07d7ca6722139cec1415a7d3e308c298512b3124/src/install_scripts/bashrc.linux#L12)

Just a quick question: Is it possible to have arbitrary collision shapes, or do these have to be basic geometric primitives?


The docs just mention primitives..


As far as I can tell, at least.


Never mind, I found the answer.

Hello there, I wanted to know if I could use the LED in RGB mode and yet control the intensity of it apart from its colour?

##### User21 02/09/2020 15:42:35
Hi there,

are there any other grippers than the 3 Finger gripper?

##### Tahir [Moderator] 02/09/2020 15:45:52
`@User21` there us ine from Robotis but I don't know if it is available in Webots, however you should be able to import it using Webots tools

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 02/10/2020 06:38:46
`@sujit`, you should be able to use your library (Tkinter) without copying it, just make sure its path is included in the `PYTHONPATH` environment variable.


You can also use a `runtime.ini` file in your controller folder to define this variable: [https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/controller-programming#environment-variables](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/controller-programming#environment-variables)


`@ian_lau` you can get the field of view with this this function: [https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/rangefinder#wb\_range\_finder\_get\_fov](https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/rangefinder#wb_range_finder_get_fov) 

Then you can get the resolution with these functions: 

[https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/rangefinder#wb\_range\_finder\_get\_width](https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/rangefinder#wb_range_finder_get_width)

Finally, you can compute the vertical field of view from the horizontal one and the resolution by using the fact that pixel are exactly squarre.

You might also be interested of gettign the maximum range of the range-finder:

[https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/rangefinder#wb\_range\_finder\_get\_max\_range](https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/rangefinder#wb_range_finder_get_max_range)****


`@Gman`, `@ƒ∞chigogo` is completely right, you can use the emitter-receiver mechanism, find an example in this sample simulation: [https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/samples-devices#emitter\_receiver-wbt](https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/samples-devices#emitter_receiver-wbt)


`@kadeng` note that arbitrary collision shapes using indexedFaceSet are working but way less efficient and stable than using a set of basic geometries.


`@sunnyjerai` unfortunately not, you can change the intensity of the red, green and blue component independently but this will of course change the color too.


`@User21`, not out of the box, but you can of course build your own gripper.

Thanks for the info `@David Mansolino` . However, is there a chance this feature might be added in future updates. Where we can control the RGB variables along with the LED's intensity?

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 02/10/2020 09:15:14
`@Heisenberg`: I was wrong, it is indeed possible to configure a LightSensor node so that it filters some color, using the colorFilter field of the LightSensor node, see documentation here: [https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/lightsensor](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/lightsensor)

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 02/10/2020 09:48:48
`@sunnyjerai` this is unfortunately not on our short term roadmap. But feel free to implement it yourself and submit a PR, we will be more than happy to review it.

I'm trying to attach a pre existing Robot model to the side of a fixed box. Just copying and pasting it as a child to the box (whether as proto node or as base node) do not seem to work. How do I achieve what I want? And how do I fix the box to the floor? (Should I just make it incredibly heavy)

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 02/10/2020 13:23:22
Hi `@kadeng`, to fix the box to the floor the simplest (and better) way to do is simply to remvoe the Physics node of the box (but not the boundingObject).


Abotu your other problem, you are not allowed to insert a Robot node in a Solid node. The workaround is to create your box node from a Robot node and simply setting the `controller` field to `none`.

##### kadeng 02/10/2020 13:26:11
After that, I would be able to put a robot node into it? Thanks, will try that.

Yes you can add a Robot 'inside' another Robot node

##### Gautier A. 02/10/2020 16:19:20
Hello !


I have a handler on an node, through a supervisor. This node is a position sensor.


Is it possible to call function specific to its type (in my case, a position sensor) through the variable (that is an "handler on a node") ?


Basically, I have a proto with a robot inside. I have position sensors on that robot. I made them visible in the scene tree by declaring a field in the proto heading. Now, I have a handler to the node, but I can't seem to be able to activate these position Sensor and retrieve their value ?


(and I can't use "getPositionSensor()" because it's not a position sensor in the robot, but in another robot that is the children of that first robot)

hi there, in webots documentation, it said that webots use pid controller to control the motor position ([https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/motor#field-summary](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/motor#field-summary).)

but how is the exact pid system in that motor controller? like in the robotis's motor it said this specification fo the controller system ([http://emanual.robotis.com/docs/en/dxl/mx/mx-64/#p-gain](http://emanual.robotis.com/docs/en/dxl/mx/mx-64/#p-gain)), but when i see the default pid controller in robotis darwin op demo it use (8 0 0), is it the right value in webots?

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 02/12/2020 06:23:10
HI `@threeal`, by default Webots uses (10, 0, 0). Note also that there is a difference between Webots and the robotis motors, Webots does a control in speed regulation whereas robotis motors do a control on torque regulation.

`@Nocturnal Warfare` Hi. In my knowledge, there is unfortunately no interface between Dronekit and Webots. It is clearly possible to implement a wrapper between them.

##### Nocturnal Warfare 02/12/2020 08:00:47
Are there any resources on how I would start making such a wrapper?

##### Fabien Rohrer [Moderator] 02/12/2020 08:06:40
`@Nocturnal Warfare` Looking at that quickly, I would create a Webots controller in Python which would simply open an UDP server, and wrap the simulated drone API with the DroneKit protocol. Then a regular dronekit script ([https://github.com/dronekit/dronekit-python#getting-started](https://github.com/dronekit/dronekit-python#getting-started)) could connect to this "fake" server to dialog with it as it is a real drone. Therefore, the main difficulty of such wrapper would be to mimic perfectly the DroneKit protocol. Does this make sense?

##### Nocturnal Warfare 02/12/2020 08:08:12
yeah i think that makes sense, thank you

Hi `@zibz`, yes, you can find examples with opencv in C++ here: [https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots/tree/master/projects/samples/howto/controllers/vision](https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots/tree/master/projects/samples/howto/controllers/vision)

And Python here: [https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots/blob/master/projects/samples/robotbenchmark/visual\_tracking/controllers/visual\_tracking/visual\_tracking.py](https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots/blob/master/projects/samples/robotbenchmark/visual_tracking/controllers/visual_tracking/visual_tracking.py)

For zbar, the integration should work the exact same way.

##### hkdeman 02/13/2020 10:36:41
Hi, I was working with ROS and Webots together. Although, when I have a supervisor mode turned on for BB-8 robot and I try getting the translation of the robot, the ROS connection crashes in Webots. Is there any alternative to getting the translation without using the supervisor? Or on how I could fix this issue?

##### Fabien Rohrer [Moderator] 02/13/2020 10:38:59
An alternative could be to use a GPS device.


This should not crash Webots. If you have a crash stack or something, please fill a bug report:

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 02/14/2020 06:38:03
`@Staff | paulthemagno`, here is an example of python controller for the NAO robot: [https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots/blob/master/projects/robots/softbank/nao/controllers/nao\_demo\_python/nao\_demo\_python.py](https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots/blob/master/projects/robots/softbank/nao/controllers/nao_demo_python/nao_demo_python.py)

##### Ptosidis\_opendr 02/14/2020 07:34:42
Hello again, 

i am trying to access the field 'rotation' within the camera of the Mavic2pro (Mavic2Pro -> cameraslot-> Camera -> Rotation) so i can manually set it from a supervisor, but I can't seem to hit it right. Could you please guide me in the right direction? (python)

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 02/14/2020 07:43:06
Hi `@Ptosidis_opendr` are you using the Supervisor API to do this ([https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/supervisor?tab-language=python](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/supervisor?tab-language=python)) ? If this is the case, you should probably check at each step if the field/node you get is correct.

##### Ptosidis\_opendr 02/14/2020 07:45:33
yeah, and even though i can get the Camera's width etc, i cant get the Rotation vector

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 02/14/2020 08:07:39
ok, that's very strange, and you get the correct value for the width ?

##### Ptosidis\_opendr 02/14/2020 08:12:43
that was probably misleading, since I got the width through the getCamera function and through that object i got the width. But since rotation is included under camera, shouldn't i be able to access it aswell? (and to anwer your question, yeah the value is the correct one)

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 02/14/2020 08:15:07
Yes you should be able to get it but not throught the camera API, you should use the Supervisor API.

##### Ptosidis\_opendr 02/14/2020 08:26:59
done, i used cam and camera for camera Api and Sup api and messed up the names along the way üôÇ

I had a question about importing my CAD .wrl into my simulation. When importing VRML file into webots, is there anyway to import it directly into the child of my robot? When I import it seems to import almost every part individually, and it throws all of the transforms into the main directory that has my WorldInfo, Floor, etc. Alternatively is there any easier way to copy those imported transforms into my robot over copying and pasting each one individually?

##### Stefania Pedrazzi [cyberbotics] 02/17/2020 07:10:17
`@Nocturnal Warfare` unfortunately VRML files  (.wrl) can only be imported at the root node. But if your CAD model has a top node and in the VRML file this top node disappears and all the parts are defined as sibling nodes, then there is probably an problem with the VRML exporter. Not sure if this would work in your applications, but an alternative to copy and paste the nodes individually could be to add an additional parent node before exporting the VRML or if it doesn't work to add a parent node directly in the generated VRML file.

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 02/17/2020 07:44:09
Hi `@User21`, this examples lets you control the robot using 'FollowJointTrajectoryAction' action (named `follow_joint_trajectory`). The state of the joints is published in the `/joint_states` topic.

`@David Mansolino` sorry for the questions about Nao in the server. I have already seen both the [https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots/tree/master/projects/robots/softbank/nao/motions](https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots/tree/master/projects/robots/softbank/nao/motions) files and the link you have posted ([https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/motion?tab-language=python](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/motion?tab-language=python)). Anyway I don't find a way for my purpose: I have a virtual map and I should synchronize it with the map of Webots. For my project the Nao has to make little steps. To make the map in Webots be the same of my virtual map, I should know how long is its step or how to change it. In this way I can change the size of the squares of the chessboard, to make the nao be at the center of a square at the end of any step. How can I do that?

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 02/17/2020 14:02:34
One simple solution would be to let the nao do several step and then check the distance made, then you can simply compute the distance per step.

##### Staff | paulthemagno 02/17/2020 14:04:28
> One simple solution would be to let the nao do several step and then check the distance made, then you can simply compute the distance per step.

`@David Mansolino` This could be a way, and to turn the nao 90¬∞? Because I see only 60, 40 and 180 in the documentation..

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 02/17/2020 14:07:29

`@David Mansolino` Thank you David. I'm trying to do as you said but I'm founding difficoulties on more than 1 consecutive steps: I put in a for the api motion.play() to do it more times. Unfortunately the nao only does the first step, but not the other ones. I think it's beacuse motion.play() only make the movement start, but doesn't wait the end of the command. Not sure if it's so. It seems that every movement is launched almost together and it takes only the first. I try to put a time.sleep(5) between every method but it didn't changhed

You are completely correct.

HOwever, time.sleep(5) will not help as it will make the controller wait, but not the simulation runs. As a first step try to call instead `robot.step(5000)`.

`@David Mansolino` Thank you very much David, it works! Can I ask if there is a way to automatically shift the robot to a certain position whithout steps? Because I have to run several epochs and the robot has to begin from the same position at the beginning of each epoch

##### Luiz Felipe 02/18/2020 02:32:40
`@Staff | paulthemagno` I think this function can help: [https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/supervisor#wb\_supervisor\_node\_reset\_physics](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/supervisor#wb_supervisor_node_reset_physics) ... before you reset physics you probably should set the translation and rotation of your robot node with setSFVec3f(translation) and setSFRotation(rotation)


My problem is similar I guess... I want to restart a simulation from a timestep, but keeping the inertia, velocities, and relocating the robots to the positions they were at that timestep (kind of a 'replay' or 'rewind function')... And start to explore again with my robots or repeat the same behavior from that 'point'/'checkpoint'... Is it possible to reset the simulation in this way? I see that when i save an html 5 animation I generate a json with rotation and translation parameters...

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 02/18/2020 06:32:57
`@Staff | paulthemagno` In that case you should probably use this instead:

```
for x in range(0, 3):
  robot.fowards.play()
  robot.step(32)
  while not robot.fowards.isOver():
    robot.step(32)
```


`@Luiz Felipe`, in that  case, restarting the controllers ([https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/supervisor#wb\_supervisor\_node\_restart\_controller](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/supervisor#wb_supervisor_node_restart_controller)) wouldn't be enough?

Hello, i'm using a supervisor node to reset a robot controller. The supervisor node and the robot node communicate with receivers/emitters both ways. They work ok up until i reset the robot controller



After resetting the robot controller and it is restarted and properly broadcasting, it seems that the supervisor receiver stops receiving the messages (the queue length stays at 0). After several steps the supervisor receiver starting picking up the messages the old messages (after reset) in order, thus they get badly desynchronized. The send method in the robot emitter properly returns 1.

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 02/18/2020 11:57:47
`@yash`: you can simply put all the Shapes nodes as the children of the same Solid.


E.g., 
```
DEF SOLID1 Solid {
  children [
    DEF SHAPE1 Shape {
      ...
    }
  ]
}
DEF SOLID2 Solid {
  children [
    DEF SHAPE2 Shape {
      ...
    }
  ]
}
```



Is merged this way:



```
DEF SOLID1+2 Solid {
  children [
    DEF SHAPE1 Shape {
      ...
    }
    DEF SHAPE2 Shape {
      ...
    }
  ]
}
```

##### yash 02/18/2020 14:11:37

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 02/18/2020 14:16:51
In that case, yes, you can do as `@Olivier Michel` said, it will result in something like:

```
DEF SOLID1+2 Solid {
  children [
    DEF SHAPE1 Shape {
      ...
    }
    DEF SHAPE2 Shape {
      ...
    }
    DEF JOINT HingeJoint {
      ...

  ]
}

`@yash` you're welcome


`@sunnyjerai`, I checked your model, and the problem is that the sliders of the gipper are not childrens of the 'Table' solid. I will send you a fixed version by mail. Note also that you should probably improve your bounding objects to use sets of basic geometries instead of indexedFaceSet, this will make the simulation run faster and more stable.

##### User21 02/18/2020 16:04:42
hi there im tring to work with moveit and webots universa robot Ur5e.

I want to give the Ur5e more the one Positions for my endeffector. At the end i want to move my endeffector to a coordinate and then i want him to wait a few seconds. After that it should move to another position.

It works for the first coordinate but after that it move uncontrollable through the world. After some time it moves to the second position. 

Did someone make some experience with controlling the ur5e with moveit over a c++ or python script?

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 02/18/2020 16:06:14
`@User21` are you using ROS1 or ROS2 ?

##### User21 02/18/2020 16:07:17
ros2

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 02/18/2020 16:08:07
Ok perfect, in that case you will find some examples here: [http://wiki.ros.org/webots\_ros2/Tutorials/webots\_ros2\_universal\_robot](http://wiki.ros.org/webots_ros2/Tutorials/webots_ros2_universal_robot)


I would also recomend to build the package from source from the master branch ([https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots\_ros2](https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots_ros2)) to get the latest improvments of the webots-ros2 interface.

Hello, after the latest update (R2020a rev1) the sphero robot is not loaded, throwing an error, both in the robot benchmarking example and the sphero/worlds/pit\_escape.wbt



The error in the console reads :

ERROR: 'C:/Program Files/Webots/projects/robots/sphero/worlds/pit\_escape.wbt':103:16: error: Skipped unknown 'BB-8' node or PROTO.

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 02/19/2020 08:36:03
Hi `@Lifebinder (tsampazk)` , let me check if I can reproduce this


I just tried on Windows with R2020a rev1 and it is working fine for me.

Can you check if you have the BB-8 PROTO file in `WEBOTS_HOME/projects/robots/sphero/bb8/protos/BB-8.proto`?

If this is not the case, can you please try uninstalling and re-installing Webots?

##### Lifebinder (tsampazk) 02/19/2020 09:01:24
this file is present in that path, maybe something went wrong on the installation of the new version over the old one? I'll try reinstalling and will get back to you

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 02/19/2020 09:06:20
`@User21` ok in that case you are using ROS1, in that case you should be able to use the RVIZ and Moveit from the 'MoveIt! with a simulated robot' part documented here: [https://github.com/ros-industrial/universal\_robot/blob/kinetic-devel/README.md](https://github.com/ros-industrial/universal_robot/blob/kinetic-devel/README.md)

(after starting the simulation with `roslaunch ur_e_webots ur5.launch` ).

##### Lifebinder (tsampazk) 02/19/2020 09:09:08
Ok now bb-8 is loaded properly. The problem seemed to be on my end, where I might have changed something that i don't remember and then updating to the new version broke it. I completely removed any related webots files and reinstalled and now it works. Thank you!

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 02/19/2020 09:09:35
Very good news, thank you for the feedback.

##### Stefania Pedrazzi [cyberbotics] 02/19/2020 09:12:27
`@Lifebinder (tsampazk)` yes, if you modified a Webots installation file, then the Webots installer cannot delete them. but the installer should report if any file cannot be deleted properly. Did you remember if it was the case for you the first time you installed Webots R2020a rev1?

##### Lifebinder (tsampazk) 02/19/2020 09:14:11
I think i would remember if it threw an error when i updated, i don't think it did. It threw an error after the uninstall process now though.

##### Stefania Pedrazzi [cyberbotics] 02/19/2020 09:15:37
OK. the error I mentioned it is not prompt in a new window, but in the logs area of the the installer report. Of course prompting it in a new window would be much more visible.

##### Lifebinder (tsampazk) 02/19/2020 09:17:22
Also i didn't mess with the bb-8 file but added some textures in the worlds directory

##### Stefania Pedrazzi [cyberbotics] 02/19/2020 09:18:41
ok, thank you for info. We will try to improve it. We already know that there are some issues uninstalling Webots on windows if the installation directory has been modified manually by the user. In fact this is not recommended.

##### Lifebinder (tsampazk) 02/19/2020 09:26:25
I don't know if its any extra help but, upon further investigation, i see that i changed the world file in the sphero/worlds and also added an extra texture in the same directory. Apparently that and updating to the new version broke the loading of the robot completely (even from other separate custom projects). Both the world and the texture files were not removed during uninstall. Thanks again.

##### sunnyjerai 02/19/2020 12:39:25
Can someone help me figure out why object keeps slipping. I've set the friction between the gripper and the object to infinity so that they won't slip. The object mass is 0.1 Kg and the robot can easily push the object.

##### Fabien Rohrer [Moderator] 02/19/2020 12:43:20
`@sunnyjerai` difficult to answer without looking at the simulation file, but it seems that the friction object-gripper and object-ground is extremely low, rather than infinity as you claim.


You should check that you defined well the friction.


To do so, you need to specify the Solid.contactMaterial fields, and then to define the WorldInfo.contactProperty for each couple of materials.


The default friction is ContactProperty.coulombFriction = 1.


2 is twice bigger.

##### sunnyjerai 02/19/2020 12:45:12
As of now, the coulombFriction between the gripper contact material and object contact material is -1(for infinity)

##### Fabien Rohrer [Moderator] 02/19/2020 12:47:49
yes, -1 is supposed to give an infinite friction.


but the result in your movie seems to contradict this.


it seems there is an issue somewhere.


could you send your world here?

##### sunnyjerai 02/19/2020 12:50:07
Yes , sure

##### Fabien Rohrer [Moderator] 02/19/2020 12:58:46

##### Fabien Rohrer [Moderator] 02/19/2020 13:03:27
> WARNING: Robot > Solid: Mass is invalid because 'boundingObject' is not defined. Using default mass properties: mass = 1, inertia matrix = identity


There is a Solid without boundingObject. That can cause issues

##### sunnyjerai 02/19/2020 13:06:01
That is the turn Table mechanism, However, it has 3 children which have their own bounding object.

##### Fabien Rohrer [Moderator] 02/19/2020 13:13:43
You should probably add a dummy boundingObject there, typically a sphere of radius 0.01


I also advise you to:


1. do not use threads, especially to trigger the robot.step()


2. to control the gripper in force/torque mode rather in position mode.


(Maybe that the gripper has too much force)


=> I'm giving a quick try to grip the object this way right now..

##### sunnyjerai 02/19/2020 13:18:48
Okay, I'll try that as well

##### Fabien Rohrer [Moderator] 02/19/2020 13:35:55
`@sunnyjerai` 3. The biggest issue is certainly that the boundingObject of the gripper plate is a mesh. This primitive is not very stable. Replacing it by a box gives much better results.



> **Attachment**: [review\_agent.wbt](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/565154703139405824/679682626185068552/review_agent.wbt)

I fixed several of these small issues, and I have now a working result, but perfectible. At least it's a new good starting sample for you.

##### sunnyjerai 02/19/2020 13:40:48
So, when I import a VRML file, I should use it only for defining geometry, however, I should use a primitive for defining the bounding object for better stability. I am getting this right?

##### Fabien Rohrer [Moderator] 02/19/2020 13:44:01
VRML does not contain data about physics, and meshes are not very stable in Webots. So I would say that critical geometries should be translated to simple primitives. In your case, I think that it's necessary to convert the wheels to cylinders, the caster wheels to spheres, and the gripper to (a set of) boxes. But the collisions over the body may be kept as a mesh.

##### sunnyjerai 02/19/2020 13:52:07
Okay, understood. You've been of  great help. Thank you `@Fabien Rohrer`

Anybody have an idea ?

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 02/19/2020 15:08:37
Hi `@Ultra_LcD` wehlcome! How did you install the webots\_ros2 package? from sources or from APT ?

##### Ultra\_LcD 02/19/2020 15:09:37
From the package manager

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 02/19/2020 15:10:35
Ok, the webots\_ros package doesn't include the Webots simulator (to be installed seperately), the simplest solution is to install the `webots_ros2_desktop` package from the package manager.

##### Ultra\_LcD 02/19/2020 15:14:23
It's already done, I found the solution.  I've manually set the environment variable: export ROS2\_WEBOTS\_HOME=/usr/local/webots

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 02/19/2020 15:20:41

I have some remarks / questions regarding Tutorial 6 (4-Wheels Robot):

- (Even if kind of obvious), the rotation of the cylinder modelling the wheels is not mentioned ( (0,0,1) 1.5707 ) 

- Why are the translations of the spheres in the dumbell (Tutorial 5) achieved via Transform Node, whereas in the Tutorial 6 they're done using the translation attribute of the wheel Solid Node ?

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 02/21/2020 13:48:09
Let me check


You're right about the cylinder rotation, I will add a not about this.


About the dumbell, a Transform is required because there is only one Solid node (the whole dumbell is considered as one single object), therefore the various part of this object (e.g. Shapes) needs to be encaspulated in a Transform otherwise they would all be centered at the origin of the Solid.

##### Axel M 02/21/2020 16:32:42
How worth is it to simulate real weights of a somewhat massive robot ? Mine is about ~3 Tons and it's sinking into the ground even if I reduce basicTimeStep. I've tried the Model 3 Tesla Model, and it stop sinking into the ground at basicTimeStep ~= 2ms. I was wondering if, dividing all weights by 100 or 1000 in order to have a higher basicTimeStep was a valid approach (I imagine it to be a tradeoff between realistic forces / torques and simulation speed ?)

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 02/21/2020 16:33:36
There are other parameters which you can tune to allow for heavy weight models. Let me check it and I will revert back to you about it here...


The boomer tractor is an example of an heavy weight vehicle: `webots/projects/vehicles/worlds/boomer.wbt` for which a number of `WorldInfo` parameters were adjusted to avoid getting the robot sinking into the ground. They are mainly `WorldInfo.ERP` and `WorldInfo.contactProperties.softCFM`. Playing with these values and going away from default value will make your simulation compliant with heavy weight vehicles.


No need to reduce the `WorldInfo.basicTimeStep` too much.


Of course, you can scale down all the masses if you don't want to modify the `WorldInfo` parameters, that should be equivalent, but maybe misleading if you look at the masses of the model...

Hi,

I want to use two ur5e with move\_it.  I followed the Gazeb Tutorial and tried to implement implement it in webots. I have to edit the launch file and i had to use the group command to seperate the published joint states. My Problem is  that Webots stops publishing so MoveIt cant plan.

Hi I am install webot - Ros2 package with mac, but problem is here..

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 02/24/2020 06:34:34
`@kimkim`, I have never tried the ROS2 package for mac, but I would be more than happy to help you using it for mac.


What is exactly your problem?


`@User21` you can use one of these launch file to launch the simulation with the universal robot and ros interface: [https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots/tree/master/projects/robots/universal\_robots/resources/ros\_package/ur\_e\_webots/launch](https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots/tree/master/projects/robots/universal_robots/resources/ros_package/ur_e_webots/launch)

Then you can use directly the launch files from the 'MoveIt! with a simulated robot' part here: [https://github.com/ros-industrial/universal\_robot/blob/kinetic-devel/README.md](https://github.com/ros-industrial/universal_robot/blob/kinetic-devel/README.md)

##### User21 02/24/2020 08:59:57
`@David Mansolino` i made my launchfile with these files you sent, but i want to use more then one robot with moveit so i have to use the group command, but when i use it (it seems like) it blocks outgoing messages from webots

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 02/24/2020 09:06:20
`@User21` ah ok, good so for 1 robot it is working?

I have never tried it with more than one robot. But this should theoretically work


What is the current problem you are facing?

##### User21 02/24/2020 09:09:30
yea its working for one robot 

the problem i am not able to launch multiple moveit Nodes to plan for each robot im using. At the begining i just want to try it for to ur5e robots


*two

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 02/24/2020 09:12:31
Ok, I will try when I have a bit of time and let you know.

##### User21 02/24/2020 09:14:43
okay thank you very much!

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 02/24/2020 09:15:11
You're welcome


`@User21` I have checked and on the Webots side the only thing you have to do is to make sure you use different prefixes in this launch file:  [https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots/blob/master/projects/robots/universal\_robots/resources/ros\_package/ur\_e\_webots/launch/ur5e\_joint\_limited.launch](https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots/blob/master/projects/robots/universal_robots/resources/ros_package/ur_e_webots/launch/ur5e_joint_limited.launch)



For the rest, it is not really related to Webots, You should probably ask directly to [https://github.com/ros-industrial/universal\_robot](https://github.com/ros-industrial/universal_robot) how you should do to control more than one arm.

##### coderrr 02/25/2020 04:23:49
Hello all,


I am a new user of webots. I want to set aperture for distance sensor. Does anyone know how to do that?

##### elkelkmuh 02/25/2020 06:06:07
Hi `@David Mansolino` First I want op2 to walk and then I want to stop and move its arms. 

How can I do it.(Normally I can do  seperately them)

I can't control the motors of the arms when I use gaitManager = RobotisOp2GaitManager(controller, "") and its initialization.

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 02/25/2020 06:33:00
Hi `@coderrr`, yes you can specify the aperture using the `aperture` of the `DistanceSensor` node. See the documentation for more information: [https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/distancesensor](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/distancesensor)


`@elkelkmuh` in that case you have to develop your own gait algorithm (or improve the existing one) as the current gait algorithms impose the position of all the motors.

##### elkelkmuh 02/25/2020 07:41:25
`@David Mansolino` first I will use gaitmanager in webots for walking. Then I will stop gait manager. Finally I will control the motors of only arm. How can stop gait manager.I will not generate new gait manager.

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 02/25/2020 07:43:28
Ok, in that case it should indeed work, for stopping it, as you can see in the doc ([https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/robotis-op2#gait-manager](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/robotis-op2#gait-manager)) there is a `stop()` function.

##### Axel M 02/25/2020 08:36:40
Is it possible to "attach a script" to a Node which is not a robot ? I would love to have a process running on a camera (to emulate an HTTP server as we have on our real sensors). Is the right way to do this to encapsulate this server inside the robot or supervisor controller ?

##### Stefania Pedrazzi [cyberbotics] 02/25/2020 08:40:32
Hi `@Axel M`, only Robot nodes can run scripts or programs. But it is possible to have nested Robot nodes, i.e. you can add a Robot node as parent of your Camera node. Each Robot node, even if nested, runs independent programs, so you will be able to run a script just for the Camera.

##### Axel M 02/25/2020 08:41:34
Thanks for your answer `@Stefania Pedrazzi`, do you recommend this approach though ? maybe some caveats appears when you run 12+ robot nodes ?

##### Stefania Pedrazzi [cyberbotics] 02/25/2020 08:46:54
Yes, this is a good approach. It depends on the complexity of the programs, but splitting them could also help making a better use of the PC's CPUs.

Hello, How to use Supervisor API for python? I have read the documentation but some sample code in python would be useful

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 02/25/2020 19:52:56
`@coderrr` instead of instatiating a Robot class you should simply instantiate a Supervisor class (it inherits from the Robot class and provide all the Supervisor methods)

##### coderrr 02/25/2020 19:53:02
what is equivalent to "wb\_supervisor\_node\_get\_from\_def" in Python?

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 02/25/2020 19:53:33

not exactly, once you did get the node, you can use it to get fields:

field = node.getField('translation')
translationValue = field.getSFVec3f()
```

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 02/25/2020 20:03:39
The value is not robot-dependant, but it is the DEF name that you defined (in your case probably 'ROBOT'). You can define the def name by selecting the node in the scene tree and then usinf the node editor: [https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/the-scene-tree#field-editor](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/the-scene-tree#field-editor)

Can I set aperture of distance sensor like this?

##### XZbot 02/25/2020 20:29:48
Hi David, I am working on a simulated maze experiment using Webots and I have a question regarding the extraction of ground-truth position of the robot during simulation. I put an e-puck in my maze and set it to start at a certain position by setting up the initial translation and rotation values under the E-puck node in the scene tree before starting simulation. In my controller code, at each simulation time step, I first extract the robot's distance sensor values, and use that to regulate its left motor and right motor speed when it moves inside the triple T maze. So the robot can now autonomously move inside the triple T-maze and turn properly at a corner or a T-intersection. My controller code is now able to extract useful sensor information and write to a csv file at each time step for each simulation trial. However, I cannot extract the translation and rotation values at each time step, although I can monitor them changing under the E-puck node in the scene tree during the simulation. The related code I have is shown below. Could you please give any suggestion of how to solve this problem? Thanks!


How I changed the motor speed is using a Robot class:

    from controller import Robot

    ...



    robot = Robot() 

    leftMotor = robot.getMotor('left wheel motor')

    rightMotor = robot.getMotor('right wheel motor')

    leftMotor.setPosition(float('inf'))

    rightMotor.setPosition(float('inf'))

    leftMotor.setVelocity(0.0)

    rightMotor.setVelocity(0.0)

    ...



    ## Inside the while loop for each time step

       ...

       #modify speed

       leftSpeed = ...

       rightSpeed = ...



       # write actuators inputs

       leftMotor.setVelocity(leftSpeed)

       rightMotor.setVelocity(rightSpeed)

       ...





How I want to extract translation and rotation value while it's autonomously moving is to use a Supervisor class, which seems to be not compatible with a Robot class: 

    

    supervisor = Supervisor()

    robotNode = supervisor.getFromDef('E-puck')

    robotTranslationField = robotNode.getField('translation')

    robotRotationField = robotNode.getField('rotation')



    ## Inside the while loop for each time step

       ...

       #read translation and rotation values

       trans = robotTranslationField.getSFVec3f()

       rotat = robotRotationField.getSFRotation()

##### Valtteri Bottas 02/25/2020 22:55:23
I have a general question. What is the most accurate value for columb friction to simulate?

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 02/26/2020 06:44:00
`@Valtteri Bottas`, it depends on the surface, there is no 'correct' global value for the columb friction.


`@coderrr`, no. You should set the aperture from the scene-tree you can't change it from the API.


`@XZbot`, you are almost there, the problem comes from the fact that the Supervisor class inherits from the Robot class, it is therefore sufficient to instantiate only the Supervisor class and use this instance instead of the robot instance, e.g.:

```Python
supervisor = Supervisor()
leftMotor = supervisor.getMotor('left wheel motor')
```

##### XZbot 02/26/2020 06:51:02

Yes, it can measures 3D forces


To measure joint a joint between the two solid must be present, and the Motor API should be used.

Do you know of a more efficient way to do this? thanks in advance

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 02/27/2020 11:03:59
Hi `@David Mansolino`, from Webots the Supervisor is indeed the way to go. Alternatively, you can write a script (in python for example) that reads direct the world or PROTO file to extract the information.

Just by curiosity, why do you need to write this URDF description?

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 02/27/2020 13:38:25
Creo use the `Anchor` WRML node (amongst other) when exporting to WRML, unfortunately this node is not supported by Webots.

##### Axel M 02/27/2020 13:48:14
Hi, I've written a webots controller in Cpp which use roscpp lib internally. If I run the controller externally, everything is working perfectly. However, running the controller inside webots gives weird random (and constant) timestamps as output of ros::Time::now()

##### Oxygenious 02/27/2020 13:49:27
`@David Mansolino` It works, thank you!

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 02/27/2020 13:53:42
`@Oxygenious` you're welcome


`@Axel M` that's strange, the behavior should be the same between intern and extern controllers. What kind og timestamps do you get? Is the time running in Webots? Are you publishing the clock topic? Are use setting 'use\_sim\_time'?

##### Axel M 02/27/2020 14:01:49
`@David Mansolino` No simulated time : so use\_sim\_time false, no /clock, and the timestamps are just plain random that goes from 1987 to 2090+


The time is running in webots, yup


In the end, my minimal code reproduction that demonstrate the problem is just :


\#include <ros/ros.h>

\#include <iostream>

\#include <memory>

\#include <webots/Robot.hpp>



using namespace webots;

int main(int argc, char** argv) {

    std::shared\_ptr<Robot> robot(new Robot());



    ros::init(argc, argv, "test\_node");

    ros::console::set\_logger\_level(ROSCONSOLE\_DEFAULT\_NAME, ros::console::levels::Debug);

    ros::NodeHandle nh;



    std::cout << "running test controller"

              << "\n";

    while (ros::ok() && robot->step(1000) != -1) {

        std::cout << ros::Time::now() << "\n";

        ros::spinOnce();

    }



    return 0;

}


Timestamp output example : 3863553536.000032767


The real part is random while the decimal part always end identically


Running externally time is running as expected ü§î

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 02/27/2020 14:05:32
Ok, thank you for this code snipet, I will try it as soon as I have a bit of time

##### Axel M 02/27/2020 14:17:44
thanks `@David Mansolino` üôÇ I updated the snipped to a fully standalone controller code. However, it needs to be linked to ros librairies


I don't know the "right" way to do it but in my case, it is compiled by a catkin CMakeLists where I added manually linking to libCppController


The only thing that comes to my mind would be a skewed LD\_LIBRARY\_PATH (As I have to set it in order to run the controller externally, maybe Webots override it and something happens with the shared libraries of ROS ?)

##### User21 02/27/2020 14:31:07
Hi there,

im using moveit with webots, and i wanted to know if the trajectoryFollower gives me feedback if i reached my goal. I need to know because i want to use it as reason to exit a while loop.

Thanks for helping!

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 02/27/2020 14:59:18
`@Axel M` Webots does indeed change the `LD_LIBRARY_PATH`, it adds some paths


Maybe that can be an explanation, because it adds `webots/projects/default/libraries/ros` to the path, maybe this cause library conflicts with your ros libraries. Can you try temporarily removing those libraries from `webots/projects/default/libraries/ros` ?


`@User21`, I assume you are using the universal robot model and ROS1, right ?

##### Axel M 02/27/2020 15:13:07
`@David Mansolino` Yup that worked


I guess the libraries you got in there are from kinetic release or something like this ?


(i'm using melodic)

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 02/27/2020 15:13:56
Perfect. In that case it means that the ros libraries shiped within webots are not compatible with the one you are using.


It is indeed from kinetic

##### Axel M 02/27/2020 15:14:18
I'm assuming having the ros libraries inside webots is to provide the ability to run a ros\_controller without having to source a workspace ?


I can open an issue on github if you wish

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 02/27/2020 15:15:12
Exactly, this is the idea, to be able to compile ROS node from Webots without needing to have the complete ROS toolchain installed.


> I can open an issue on github if you wish

`@David Mansolino`  Yes üòÑ Sorry for these questions but im not quite familiar with ros im just learning it. I appreciate your help very much.

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 02/28/2020 06:27:52
`@User21`, no problem, yes you can simply check if your action client state is succeded, see this example: [http://wiki.ros.org/actionlib#C.2B-.2B-\_SimpleActionClient](http://wiki.ros.org/actionlib#C.2B-.2B-_SimpleActionClient)

##### User21 02/28/2020 11:06:46
Hey i have a Problem with the rotation of the ur5e. Can i predefine a rotation for that robot and then rotate it from there? I want to rotate the robot around the robots z Axis over a supervisor filed but its not that easy possible because i get multiple changes in the x,y,z rotations

##### schadocalex 02/28/2020 11:11:26
Hi, Webots is awesome! But I have a problem. I have a big world definition input, that say for example "one tree is at this position". I can have thousands of trees. I have two solutions, for both I can't find how to do it in Webots:

1) Generate a big world file and then load it. But there is no LOD or something so there will be too much objects in the scene, I think. Maybe I can make chunks of the maps and load them depending of my main robot pos? Is it possible?

2) Have a standalone script that instantiate models dynamically in the world, depending on robot pos.

Thanks!

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 02/28/2020 11:17:41
Hi `@schadocalex`, I believe the second option you propose is probably the best way to go. This script could actually be implemented as a Webots Supervisor. Also, instead of instantiating new models, it could simply move existing models (e.g., trees) that are already loaded in the world file.

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 02/28/2020 11:20:08
`@User21` the workaround is to put your robot in the children field of another Robot node (whose controller is set to 'none') this way you have two independant rotation fields to manipulate. But it would be cleaner to handle rotation combination directly in your Supervisor.


`@schadocalex`, alternatively the `Forest` PROTO node allows you to define the position of a large number of three in a file in an efficient way: [https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/object-trees#forest](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/object-trees#forest)

##### schadocalex 02/28/2020 11:35:42
Thanks for the fast answers.

Ok so Webots Supervisors are the way to do it.

About Forest PROTO, can I add my own tree types? Because it‚Äôs not really trees I want, I have my own custom models.

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 02/28/2020 11:38:25
No the PROTO works indeed only for trees (but you might get inspiration from it if needed), but if your original model contains many triangles then the Supervisor is indeed the way to go.

##### schadocalex 02/28/2020 11:41:48
Yes my models are not very low poly ones. Thanks!

##### User21 02/28/2020 12:15:54
`@David Mansolino` Thank you!


If i do it with  two robot nodes i cant enabel my arm sensors. Is it because it cant find the sensors from a robot in arobot node?

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 02/28/2020 13:23:47
You can't indeed acess devices of a child robot, robot can only access it's own devices (not including devices from sub-robot)

##### User21 02/28/2020 13:24:21

Hello, is there any sample use "setPosition" to control robot

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 02/28/2020 15:29:10
Hi `@kwy` you mean the motor.setPosition function, right?

##### kwy 02/28/2020 15:30:56
yes. i want to set the relative position in a map

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 02/28/2020 15:32:08
This function is not for setting the map position directly, but for acting on a joint position.

If you want to set the absolute position of a robot on a map you should use the Supervisor API: [https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/supervisor](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/supervisor)

##### kwy 02/28/2020 15:36:22
thanks, is there any sample to show this function?

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 02/28/2020 15:36:58
Yes, this sample show how to move a light to a defined location for example: [https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/samples-devices#supervisor-wbt](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/samples-devices#supervisor-wbt)


(it is in C, but other languages works the same way)

##### kwy 02/28/2020 15:45:43
wow,the location of the PointLight is moved.. so i can change the location of a robot (x,y,ùúë) on a map with Supervisor

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 02/28/2020 15:46:07

hello,how to add a all direction wheel in the webots????this question has fused me for two days::i used two joint\_hinge one for z axis rotation and the other for x axis rotaton, when i simulate this wheel didn't work as i think.

##### User21 02/29/2020 15:42:48
`@David Mansolino` 

I dont understand the last function of the TrajectoryFollower code from the universal\_robots\_ros controller. These function gets called in the while loop of the universal\_robots\_ros python script and its executing planned path.

Here the Code:
> **Attachment**: [message.txt](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/565154703139405824/683338393370886267/message.txt)


When i test the code the last else function never gets called and throught that the goal\_handle.set suceeded never gets called. And to my knowledge is that the way i get the feedback if my robot reached the goal. Im quite confused about the variable goal\_handle because of his type. its either None or some sort of adress. maybe im just missing something. I hope you understand my problem.

Can anyone help with webots for nao? There's no option to open an account which is requested.


Password "webots" results in "Bla bla no license" and a dead link.


Doesn't work with "webots@cyberbotics.com"

either... `@David Mansolino` Sorry to bother but you seem to know your way around here. May I have some assistance please?

##### asphyxia 03/01/2020 17:29:54
Hello, I think I have found a race condition between `Supervisor::simulationReset()` and `Robot::tick()`. If `simulationReset()` is called before `tick()` (with a nonzero step), sometimes `tick()` will wait until the simulation time is `step` ms after the time *before* `simulationReset` was called, instead of `step` ms after time 0, causing the simulation to run for much more than `step` ms (e.g. if `simulationReset` is called at 5.000 seconds simulation time, and then `tick(32)` is called, `tick` will return after another 5 seconds - when the simulation time has gone from 0s up to 5.032s). I can't seem to reproduce this too reliably (I just ran a test 10 times, and the race happened twice); I'm using python 3.8 on a synchronized controller.

##### LaCava 03/01/2020 17:55:44
Hi all -- I'm trying to keep track of the position in space (X, Y, Z) of a few choice parts of a robot (Softbank NAO). I'm aware of the different spatial sensors, but I'm looking for a more direct way to track those values with a supervisor.


Wait

Just as I've sent that I remembered there are available 'slots', so I assume I can add non-colliding nodes there and just track those.

##### jinu061353 03/02/2020 03:42:19
Does anyone know the mass of a darwin-op3 in Webots?

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 03/02/2020 06:30:01
Hi `@jinu061353`, the total mass of the darwin-op3 is ~3.1 kg. You can easily see this in Webots by selecting the robot node and then the 'mass' node in the field/node editor: [https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/the-scene-tree#field-editor](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/the-scene-tree#field-editor)


`@LaCava` This is indeed the simplest solution üôÇ


`@asphyxia` what do you mean by `tick()` are you refeering to `wb_robot_step()` ? If this is the case, may I ask you to open a bug report (including a sample controller) here: [https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots](https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots)

Thank you.


`@Deep` have you tried with 'webots@cyberbotics.com' as email and 'webots' as password?

##### asphyxia 03/02/2020 06:32:29
sorry, yes I meant `step()`, idk what I was thinking lol. I'll file an issue soon

`@asphyxia` thank you.


`@User21` goal\_handle is a handle to the current target trajectory received. The last if should indeed be raised when the robot reaches the target position. Maybe the tolerance is to small, you may reduce the tolerance sent to the `within_tolerance` function. You may also print the difference between curent and target position to check what is hapenning exactly.

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 03/02/2020 07:56:51
`@Deep`: Be sure to use a version of Webots that works with this "webots" password, e.g., Webots 8.4.0 for example.

What's the difference between a SFNode and a MFNode ?

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 03/02/2020 10:33:40
SFNode stands for Single Field Node and MFNode stands for Multiple Field Node.

Therefore, SFNode allows to insert one single node, whereas MFNode allows to import as many nodes as you want.

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 03/02/2020 10:42:53
I am not familliar with pyinstaller, btu you should probably make sure that the correct environment variables are set, e.g.: [https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/running-extern-robot-controllers?tab-os=linux&tab-language=python#environment-variables](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/running-extern-robot-controllers?tab-os=linux&tab-language=python#environment-variables)

##### l\_eslam\_l 03/02/2020 13:07:39
`@David Mansolino` 

I actually tried both methods, and both methods gave me the exact same error

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 03/02/2020 13:07:54
ok, let me try

##### l\_eslam\_l 03/02/2020 13:08:01
ok

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 03/02/2020 13:14:35
I just tried and it is working fine for me. Can you maybe try with another example (such as `roslaunch webots_ros e_puck_line.launch`)?


Which version of ROS are you using?

##### l\_eslam\_l 03/02/2020 13:26:27
Yeah I tried all the other examples and they're all working fine

I'm using melodic


I tried the pioneer example because it is so related to my project

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 03/02/2020 13:28:54
Ok, it's a good news that the other nodes are working.

The complete test has similar errors too!

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 03/02/2020 13:30:17
In that case you should probably try runnign this example without the launch file. you can launch manually with this porocedure:

  - start roscore.

  - open Webots and open the 'projects/languages/ros/worlds/pioneer3at.wb' world.

  - launch the `pioneer3at` node from the `webots_ros` package.

##### l\_eslam\_l 03/02/2020 13:30:57
For these errors, there are no corresponding errors on the terminal screen, just webots console

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 03/03/2020 16:17:12
`@User21` probably that this launch file should be updated:

```
roslaunch ur5_moveit_config ur5_moveit_planning_execution.launch
```

But this launch file is unfotunately not owned by us, you should probably create a local copy of it and modify it


For example this line does not take the node name into account: 

[https://github.com/ros-industrial/universal\_robot/blob/06d8b9e2f5f86aa54f9f2845f11edbc84e2f951e/ur5\_moveit\_config/launch/ur5\_moveit\_planning\_execution.launch#L7](https://github.com/ros-industrial/universal_robot/blob/06d8b9e2f5f86aa54f9f2845f11edbc84e2f951e/ur5_moveit_config/launch/ur5_moveit_planning_execution.launch#L7)

the problem is that this error message occurs:                                                             

 ERROR: Skipped unknown 'myprotoname' node or PROTO.                                                  

this message appears when I load the project or cut and paste the object. but I'm able to instantiate it and see it. what can it be the problem?

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 03/04/2020 06:46:44
Hi `@Axel M` yes of course, you cn use the `wb_supervisor_field_import_sf_node_from_string` to import any node:

```
wb_supervisor_field_import_sf_node_from_string("MyProto { translation 0 1 1 }");
```


`@User21` perfect, thanks again fo r the feedback!

You are right, the next steps are more on the MoveIt side than Webots, but I am sure you can get help for this in the ROS community.


`@Massimo Sirigu` Hi, where is located the file ``myprotoname.proto`` ? Would you agree sharing it with us?

##### Axel M 03/04/2020 09:13:29
Thanks `@David Mansolino` üôÇ

##### SimonDK 03/04/2020 10:05:18
We are looking at modeling the RG2 gripper ([https://onrobot.com/en/products/rg2-gripper](https://onrobot.com/en/products/rg2-gripper)). Are we so lucky that anyone already did this? üôÇ Any recommendations for modeling this kind of tool?


Small video to show how the RG2 moves: [https://youtu.be/v2vY7YfXHYE](https://youtu.be/v2vY7YfXHYE)

Is it possible to model this, I guess it is quite similar to the Schunk three-finger gripper?

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 03/04/2020 10:24:55
I don't know any model of this gripper in Webots yet. But it is for sure feasible to model such kind of gripper in Webots, it is indeed similar to [https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/gripper-actuators#robotiq-3f-gripper](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/gripper-actuators#robotiq-3f-gripper)

Maybe you can find an URDF model and use the importer: [https://github.com/cyberbotics/urdf2webots](https://github.com/cyberbotics/urdf2webots)

##### JC 03/04/2020 10:58:39
Hi, i have a controller that runs a simulation then resets using supervisor.simulationReset() , then changes some variables before running again . This repeats a fair few times but each time the simulation takes longer and longer to reset. Is there any way to remedy this?

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 03/04/2020 12:43:20
Hi, `@JC` this should in theory not be the case, are you adding some node while the simulation it running from your supervisor or something similar?

##### SimonDK 03/04/2020 12:45:20
Great, thank you very much `@David Mansolino` , forgot about the URDF importer, will see if I can find a URDF model of the gripper. If I do not want to simulate the physics behind grasping, can I cheat and attache the object to the gripper with a fixed joint or something?

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 03/04/2020 12:46:37
Yes of course, you can either put the object directly as a child node of the gripper for creatign a fix joint or use connector nodes: [https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/connector](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/connector)

##### SimonDK 03/04/2020 12:47:52

##### JC 03/04/2020 12:57:07
i made another controller just to be sure, this other controller is  just this:from controller import Supervisor



\# create the Robot instance.

supervisor = Supervisor()



timestep = 640





while supervisor.step(timestep) != -1:

    

    supervisor.simulationRes()


discord messed the formating of it but its got no errors and the simulation takes longer and longer to reset even though the only thing im doing is resetting, any ideas?

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 03/04/2020 12:58:14
Thank you, I will try it

##### JC 03/04/2020 12:58:48
accidently deleted some from the end of supervisor.SimulationReset() when copying over


but other than that its exactly what ive got


also im using the sony Aibo robot if that helps

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 03/04/2020 13:27:17
`@JC` I can indeed reproduce the issue you are mentioning thank to your controller, it seems the problem is on the Webots side, I did open an issue about this and we will try to fix this for the next release of Webots: [https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots/issues/1432](https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots/issues/1432)


`@User21` I am sorry but I have no idea, but I am sure this is feasible because RVIZ is able to detect it (when used with this example: [https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots/blob/master/projects/robots/universal\_robots/resources/ros\_package/ur\_e\_webots/README.md#usage](https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots/blob/master/projects/robots/universal_robots/resources/ros_package/ur_e_webots/README.md#usage) )

##### coderrr 03/05/2020 14:12:34
Hello, Whenever I check the box and make supervisor = True for e-puck, webot starts to not responding

Is there any other way to getPosition for e-puck? as it does not have touch sensor and the supervisor approach is not working for E-puck.

##### ptrepag 03/05/2020 15:10:59
I am attempting to use Webots to simulate a robot for our First Tech Challenge student team.  Our robot has Mecanum wheels, and I am having a tough time trying to figure out how to rip the wheels out of the Kuka Youbot and get them into another robot.  Has anyone successfully used Mecanum wheels in a separate robot?

##### kevinW 03/06/2020 04:07:48
Hello everyone, I am doing Machine Learning on Webots, and have already made my custom robot, and my neural network. I just need to figure out how to reset the Robot..... I am using python, and the function: simulationReset() just crashes the whole program.   Next, I tried resetting all the positions, but the function setMFRotation(...) takes an index, and if I tried working with it, but failed. (i have 30 rotational motors).... Why is resetting the robot so complex?

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 03/06/2020 07:44:00
`@lench`: I would recommend to have a look at our pedestrian simulation in Webots/projects/humans/pedestrian/worlds/pedestrian.wbt. It's a Python controller, but doesn't use ROS. It shouldn't be difficult however to control it from ROS.


`@coderrr`: Making the e-puck a supervisor should work. Did you try to save and restart Webots? Otherwise, you can add a GPS device to the e-puck to retrieve its position.


`@ptrepag`: when importing the Mecanum wheels from the Kuka youBot, you should copy the WorldInfo node as it includes important parameters allowing the Mecanum wheels to work properly, in particular the ContactProperties.


`@kevinW`: simulationReset should not crash Webots. If it does, please fill in a bug report on [https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots/issues/new?template=bug\_report.md](https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots/issues/new?template=bug_report.md) with all the details allowing us to reproduce the crash.


`@elkelkmuh`: the gait manager controls the movements of the legs and the arms as well, so, you cannot move the arms while the robot is walking with the gait manager.  You should stop the gait manager to move the arms.


`@elkelkmuh`: you should call gaitManager.step() in a conditional test: when you want to move the arms, don't call it and when you want the robot to walk, call it.


```c++
bool move_arms;
[...]
if (move_arms) {
  // control the arm movement
} else 
  gaitManager.step(basicTimeStep);
```

##### ptrepag 03/06/2020 13:40:19
`@Olivier Michel` thank you for the pointer on the WorldInfo node.  I was wondering where the special friction came from.  I am still very new to Webots, so I have some dumb questions.  If I want to resize the wheels, do I just change the size of the Cylinder bounding object?  Or do I also need to apply a sizing transformation elsewhere?

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 03/06/2020 13:49:40
This special friction is needed to simulate the asymmetric friction of the Mecanum wheels. See the documentation here: [https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/contactproperties](https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/contactproperties)


You should probably resize sub-wheels as well.

##### Axel M 03/06/2020 15:03:20
Hi,

Can a supervisor controller change WorldInfo.gpsReference during the runtime, and if so, will the change be effective ?

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 03/06/2020 15:08:14
It can certainly change it. Not sure if the change will be effective. You should try and let us know üòâ

##### Axel M 03/06/2020 15:08:38
I'm gonna try, thanks üôÇ


It's working as expected

Cool. Thank for the feedback!

##### mero 03/06/2020 16:05:27
Hello, I am trying to get the current position of the joints in the hand of the tiago titanium after moving it. I tried using the wb\_position\_sensor\_enable() for all the joints in a loop but it gives me an error of invalid device tag.

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 03/06/2020 16:07:07
This is because your device tag is not properly initialized. You probably used a wrong name?

##### mero 03/06/2020 16:09:25
I used the names given in the webots sample for the tiago and initialized the device tags first.  This is the code:   for (int i = 0; i < N\_PARTS; i++) {

    robot\_parts[i] = wb\_robot\_get\_device(names[i]);

    wb\_motor\_set\_velocity(robot\_parts[i], wb\_motor\_get\_max\_velocity(robot\_parts[i])/2.0);

    wb\_position\_sensor\_enable(robot\_parts[i], 64);

  }

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 03/06/2020 16:10:12
The position sensors are different devices from the motors. They have a different name as well.

##### mero 03/06/2020 16:10:39
from where can i get their names?

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 03/06/2020 16:10:49
From the proto files.


Look for example into webots/projects/robots/pal\_robotics/tiago\_extensions/protos/TiagoFrontArm.proto


And you will see that a motor is named "arm\_1\_joint" and the corresponding position sensor is named "arm\_1\_joint\_sensor".


You should be able to see this from the robot window if you double-click on the Tiago robot in Webots and then display the position sensors.

##### mero 03/06/2020 16:13:25

Hey guys. I compiled a control for nao with naoqi enabled thanks to the help of one of the people here, and it connects to the required software as it should.



I am now facing a small need. I am trying to a send a tiny object recognition database to the virtual robot(Through naoqi). It seems that when I try to do so I'm getting an error that perhaps there is no memory left on the robot. And the connection with the robot is closed. I was wondering if anyone may have a tip as to how I could solve this issue.

##### Soheil 03/08/2020 15:09:40
I have a humanoid robot which is something like a modified version of robotis op3. When I change its rotation, the robot surprisingly happens to face ridiculous problems. For example, its joints start to take apart or merge into each other. Does anyone has any idea about this?

##### Shadow 03/08/2020 20:38:25
When ever I open the velocity tab in the hierarchy window of a solid node with no physics node (NULL), webots crashes.

##### Stefania Pedrazzi [cyberbotics] 03/09/2020 07:06:55
`@Shadow` could you please write a bug report in GitHub and provide a sample world where you can reproduce this crash? [https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots/issues/new/choose](https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots/issues/new/choose) I checked a couple of worlds on Linux with the latest Webots version but everything works fine for me


`@Soheil` how do you change the rotation of the robot? Usually when changing the position or rotation of a robot from the controller program it is recommended to reset the physics to avoid this kind of issues (see [https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/supervisor#wb\_supervisor\_node\_reset\_physics](https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/supervisor#wb_supervisor_node_reset_physics))

##### soheil 03/09/2020 07:21:11
`@Stefania Pedrazzi` Firstly Thanks for your answer. I found out that was because the vector (x, y, z) was not unit length. That should not be forgotten. And I do reset the node physics. But this problem will happen in a long run(for example 1000 times of changing the rotation)  despite it is really less than the last case. How do you think I can handle it?

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 03/09/2020 07:48:45
`@Deep`: your question seems to be specific to naoqi and not to Webots. I am sorry I won't be able to help you. You should maybe ask to naoqi experts instead, maybe SoftBank robotics support?

##### Stefania Pedrazzi [cyberbotics] 03/09/2020 08:57:48
`@soheil` good to know! I will check the unit vector issue and improve the documentation if needed.

Maybe you could try to reset the whole simulation after many robot moves ([https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/supervisor#wb\_supervisor\_simulation\_reset\_physics](https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/supervisor#wb_supervisor_simulation_reset_physics)).

##### yash 03/09/2020 09:54:54
My robot consists of different solid nodes.......therefore after enabling the physics mode should have to provide the parameters such as mass,density etc of all the solid nodes or


just provide the parameters to the main robot node


as you can see the physics mode enabled under the main robot node ....so should I just specify the parameters in that or also to the physics node under solid nodes present in its children

##### Stefania Pedrazzi [cyberbotics] 03/09/2020 10:07:13
`@yash` yes, each Solid node in your model represents a real part of your robot, so it has a mass or density and specific physics properties that you should specify to build a realisitc model. Here is the documentation of the Physics nodes: [https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/physics#how-to-use-physics-nodes](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/physics#how-to-use-physics-nodes). 

If you don't need to specify the physics properties of a Solid node, then it could be that you don't need to use a Solid node, but maybe it could be replaced by a Group or Transform node.

Hi there,

im having 2 Robots. One Ur5e and a Pioneer 3Dx. The Pioneer should move to the Ur5e and wait till the Ur5e grabs an object and place it on the Pioneer. Can i access my Ur5e Controller from my Pioneer Controller to get Feedback if my Ur5e reached his goal?

##### Stefania Pedrazzi [cyberbotics] 03/09/2020 11:00:49
Hi`@User21`, the controller programs are independent. You can use the Emitter/Receiver nodes to communicate between the Ur5e controller and the Pioneer controller.

##### Deep 03/09/2020 11:02:15
`@Olivier Michel` I understand that, I just wondered if there are similar things such as that with other robots.



Anyway. I'd like to ask something else.

It seems like the simulation is not 100% the same every run.

There are different mechanical error each run. Is that intended?

Is running under "real time" mode would make it more consistent?

Any other tip?

Thanks

##### User21 03/09/2020 11:02:39
`@Stefania Pedrazzi` okay thank you

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 03/09/2020 11:08:13
`@Deep`: Webots simulation are 100% reproducible if the controller programs are synchronous and deterministic. In case of use with naoqi, the non-reproducibility comes likely from naoqi and also from the fact that the naoqisim controller may be asynchronous (if Nao.synchonization = FALSE). See explanation here: [https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/robot#field-summary](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/robot#field-summary)


See [https://github.com/cyberbotics/naoqisim/blob/master/worlds/naoqisim.wbt#L44](https://github.com/cyberbotics/naoqisim/blob/master/worlds/naoqisim.wbt#L44)

Hi `@kimkim` , just looking at the screenshot you posted there is a mismatch between the python versions (you run python 3.8  but you link to python 3.7).

i would suggest you first to check that all the reported resources exist and the paths are correct (for example the `Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.7/Python` and the Webots `_controller.so` path)

##### kimkim 03/10/2020 08:13:55
you are right.. I already checked the pre - reported resources, but I could not find exact fit to me.

what do you mean? that the path doesn't exist?

##### kimkim 03/10/2020 08:17:46

This should not be needed. The error message says that `Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.7/Python` image is not found, not `_controller.so`.

I'm trying to upgrade my webots in ubuntu 16.04. But removing using ubuntu software does not work. just deleting the webots folder in \usr\local is enough for a complete uninstall?

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 03/11/2020 10:07:50
That's indeed probably enough, but what is the issue you get when uninstalling normally ?

##### taeyoung 03/11/2020 10:10:58
When I click Remove or Launch using the Ubuntu Software nothing happens. Even to open the simulator, I just use the terminal with the command 'webots'

##### Stefania Pedrazzi [cyberbotics] 03/11/2020 10:13:30
`@taeyoung` did you installed Webots from the snap store or the debian package?

##### taeyoung 03/11/2020 10:14:48
Ubuntu 16.04, and  using debian

##### Stefania Pedrazzi [cyberbotics] 03/11/2020 10:14:51
did you try to run `sudo apt-get remove webots` in a terminal to uninstall Webots?

##### taeyoung 03/11/2020 10:16:32
When i did that, it shows 'Unmet dependencies. Try "apt-get -f install' with no packages (or specify a solution)."

##### Stefania Pedrazzi [cyberbotics] 03/11/2020 10:17:04
is it the same with  `dpkg --remove webots`?


but usually you first have to fix the broken package before being able to uninstall it


for example running

```apt-get clean && apt-get autoremove
sudo apt-get -f install
dpkg --configure -a
```

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 03/12/2020 07:00:23
`@coderrr`, one simple solution is to check the bounding object of the robot in its PROTO, for example for the e-puck robot the radius of the cylinder is 0.037 meters: [https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots/blob/master/projects/robots/gctronic/e-puck/protos/E-puck.proto#L1138](https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots/blob/master/projects/robots/gctronic/e-puck/protos/E-puck.proto#L1138)

Excuse me for my english grammar mistakes

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 03/12/2020 08:41:37
It seems that somehow you controller exists sometime before the first step in a unusual way and therefore Webots is not aware that the controller exited. This is why it is not able to 'release' the controller and therefore displays this warning.

Woudl this make sense in your case ?

##### Laojiang 03/12/2020 08:43:13
yes yes , I agree with you!


So what can I do to solve it?

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 03/12/2020 08:49:40
Unfortunately sicne webots is not yet able to detect crash/unexpected exit of the controller yet, the workaround is to manually revert the simulation before you start the controller from PyCharm.

##### Laojiang 03/12/2020 08:54:39
yes, you are right. After I revert the simulation, the warning is gone. However, the time still doesn't increase. And robots doesn't move, too.

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 03/12/2020 08:55:28
The time will increase only when you start the controller and the controller calls the 'step' function.

##### Laojiang 03/12/2020 08:57:37

How can I reach a GPS node and use getSpeed from another controller? I'm trying to read the velocity of a pedestrian, which uses the controller implemented in the pedestrian.wbt (it is translated, it does not move). Thanks!

##### Stefania Pedrazzi [cyberbotics] 03/12/2020 10:25:50
`@yash` for a simple example you can look at the Camera device sample simulation: [https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/samples-devices#camera-wbt](https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/samples-devices#camera-wbt)

The method you use depends on what you want to achieve. You can use common image processing based on the Camera image.


`@nelsondmmg` you cannot control directly a device from another robot controller.

But instead you can let the two robot controllers communicate (for example using the Emitter/Receiver nodes). You should modify the pedestrian controller so that it processes your request to get the velocity and sends it back to your controller.

##### Axel M 03/12/2020 14:22:18
Hi, in which frame does `wb_supervisor_node_get_velocity` express it's velocities ? In world frame or local node frame ?


The doc specifies that `wb_supervisor_node_get_position` is relative to the global (world) frame

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 03/12/2020 14:24:37
Hi `@Axel M`, let me check.

##### Axel M 03/12/2020 14:24:58
(My experiments shows me that get\_velocity seems to be also in the global frame)

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 03/12/2020 14:25:46
Yes that's it, it is global velocity.

##### Axel M 03/12/2020 14:26:57
I want to get velocity of a Solid given it's own frame, is the only solution to use  `wb_supervisor_node_get_orientation`, transpose it, and multiply the global velocity vector with it (ugh, not easy) ?

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 03/12/2020 14:28:15
That's indeed the only solution.

##### Axel M 03/12/2020 14:30:37
Would you recommend usingwebots.maths for this kind of operations (even if the API isn't public) ?

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 03/12/2020 14:31:24
You can, but you can also probably find some libraries that can handle such transformations out of the box.

Hey, I want to add a flying human face with approximately realistic properties and texture. Is there a model such as this for me to download?

I noticed the human being in the software doesn't have face.



I just need a static flying face.

Thanks a bunch.

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 03/12/2020 15:15:18
Hi `@Deep`, no such human face are available out of the box in Webots. However you can create your own model by importing any human face model you can find on internet in VRML format using in IndexedFaceSet (see for example: [https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/samples-geometries#high\_resolution\_indexedfaceset-wbt](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/samples-geometries#high_resolution_indexedfaceset-wbt))

##### Deep 03/12/2020 15:23:12

(If I may ask)

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 03/12/2020 16:33:07
You're welcome


It is not possible out of the box to ignore gravity for one specific object, but you might add a force opposed to the gravity to cancel it using the `wb_supervisor_node_add_force` function: [https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/supervisor#wb\_supervisor\_node\_add\_force](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/supervisor#wb_supervisor_node_add_force)

##### LaCava 03/13/2020 10:48:33
Is there any way to add a recognition node to a robot that doesn‚Äôt have it by default? I tried adding to to the PROTO in the world file, but the camera itself isn‚Äôt actually specified in the PROTO so it won‚Äôt recognize it.

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 03/13/2020 10:49:23
Hi `@LaCava`, so where is the camera defined? In the open fields of the PROTO?

##### LaCava 03/13/2020 10:51:30
Not sure: the PROTO itself has fields like the camera width and height. I have to access it in the controller through the getCamera functions, but there are no fields corresponding to it anywhere else.

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 03/13/2020 10:54:25
Ok, in that case the camera is probably defined in the PROTO, are you using a PROTO distributed within Webots?

##### LaCava 03/13/2020 10:56:18
Yup - it‚Äôs the NAO. May just be misunderstand how to do this, sorry about that. I appreciate the help.


Ahh yup, found it in the full-fat NAO PROTO ‚Äî can I just manually add the recognition node of the field isn‚Äôt listed?


^ that worked, it seems!

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 03/13/2020 11:03:39
Yes you should be able to add it directly here: [https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots/blob/master/projects/robots/softbank/nao/protos/Nao.proto#L797](https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots/blob/master/projects/robots/softbank/nao/protos/Nao.proto#L797)


Alternatively you can "un-prototize" you node by re-clicking on the node in the scene-tree and selecting 'Convert to Base Node(s)'.

##### Deep 03/13/2020 12:42:06
`@David Mansolino` If I get this straight, when importing a 3D object I have to set its collision detection parameters which are required for any physical force to be applicable on it?

##### User21 03/13/2020 15:29:53
Okay, if i have two robots and i want to get the translation from the second one at the first one i can call the node by using getFromDef.

Is ther another posibility to get the node?


My goal is to set the name from the robot in code and call the set name without naming them manual


*manually

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 03/13/2020 15:32:23
Yes of course, you can get the root node of the world using the wb\_supervisor\_node\_get\_root ([https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/supervisor#wb\_supervisor\_node\_get\_root](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/supervisor#wb_supervisor_node_get_root)) function. This root node is a hidden 'Group' node, you can therefore get its 'children' field and parse all the nodes inside.

##### User21 03/13/2020 15:33:07

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 03/13/2020 15:57:22
You can use the 'controllerArgs' field to define the position, this controllerArgs fields defines the arguments with which the controller is started

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 03/15/2020 19:08:25
Hi, I have a general question about Webots, compared to Gazebo or other simulators. I'm looking for the best Simulator to use for training Reinforcement learning algorithms. One major deciding factor is the simulation speed. With gazebo, it is hard for me to get over 1-2x real time factor. It simply doesnt scale with more cores, or uses any GPU acceleration for physics calculations. Can anyone give me some info, how Webots performs and scales?

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 03/16/2020 06:48:04
Hi `@Simon Steinmann`, generally speaking Webots is faster than Gazebo, this is mainly due to its native intensive usage of the GPU. Many simulations run at a speed way higher than 1-2x real time. But the best is to make yourself your own idea by trying it, when you install Webots you get plenty of sample simulations that will allow you to quickly check the simulation speed of Webots on your computer.

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 03/16/2020 08:37:21
`@David Mansolino` Hi, thx for the reply. Does Webots use GPU for physics calculation, or just for rendering? I tried Webots a little 6 month ago and it definitely looks better visually, but my main concern is the physics simulation speed.

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 03/16/2020 09:24:49
It is indeed only for rendering, for physics, you might use the multi-CPU feature of Webots (disable by default): see 'optimalThreadCount' field documentation: [https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/worldinfo#worldinfo](https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/worldinfo#worldinfo)

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 03/16/2020 10:35:04
So the main difference in performance between Webots and Gazebo (since both use ODE) stems from the model refinement you guys do? Like replacing meshes with simple geometry like cylinders and spheres where applicable? Also, is there a list of already implemented and future implemented robots. For example KUKA or Kinova robotic arms would be very interesting.

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 03/16/2020 10:39:30
They indeed both use ODE, howver, Webots uses a customized version of ODE with multi-thread support.

About the models, it is true that Webots use more optmized model (both on the rendering and physical side).

About the robot models, here is a list of available model by default in Webots (but you might find some other maintained by the community on internet): [https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/robots](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/robots)


You might also use the URDF to Webots to import new model: [https://github.com/cyberbotics/urdf2webots](https://github.com/cyberbotics/urdf2webots)

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 03/16/2020 10:43:14
thank you for the infos üôÇ


Do you have current plans of adding Kinova robotic arms? It is very popular in research and teaching. Adding the JACO2 and JACO3 arms would make webots a good alternative to Gazbeo and ROS

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 03/16/2020 10:45:55
It is indeed a good candidate, unforunately we only have limited time and much to do, so its not on our short term plan.


But we have the universal robot arms: [https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/ure](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/ure)

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 03/16/2020 11:38:56
Have you considered an unofficial supported robot list, where users can submit their files? So not multiple people have to do the same work over and over again. For example, If I were to make the kinova JACO2 robotic arm run in Webots, it would be helpful for others, to easily be able to find it and use it as a starting point for their work.

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 03/16/2020 11:43:42
Yes, this is on our roadmap, we plan to create a platform for the community to share their models. However, in the meantime, we highly encourage users to create a pull-request to include their model directly in the main repository: [https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots](https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots)

If you create a model of the kinova JACO2 robotic arm we will be more than happy to assist you for integrating it in Webots.

##### Stefania Pedrazzi [cyberbotics] 03/16/2020 16:27:52
`@Simon Steinmann` Supervisor class inherits from Robot class, so you can simply write

`robot = Supervisor()`


About OpenAI gym there is currently no official implementation for Webots. But it is possible to write a custom interface for it.

We know that some users are implementing an interface for OpenAI but it is not public yet

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 03/16/2020 16:45:29
Thank you, the supervisor thing worked :). Can you recommend a good starting point for the OpenAI implementation? Doesnt have to be perfect or 100% working. Some python controller examples would already help a lot.

##### Stefania Pedrazzi [cyberbotics] 03/16/2020 16:53:41
unfortunately there is no sample simulation using AI or similar in Python. The `advanced_genetic_algorithm` simulation (you can search for it in `File > Open Sample World...`)  uses a C supervisor controller but it could help you structuring your Python controller.

I would like to send it to receiver in another node (in this case emulation a vehicle 2 vehicle communication). There is this phrase: **The wb\_emitter\_send function adds to the emitter's queue a packet of size bytes located at the address indicated by dataThe wb\_emitter\_send function adds to the emitter's queue a packet of size bytes located at the address indicated by data**, but I don't know how to create the packet adding the message + address. 



As a following question: is there a way to send a broadcast message? Thanks

##### Stefania Pedrazzi [cyberbotics] 03/17/2020 09:58:18
`@nelsondmmg` the Emitter message is sent to a specific channel and all the Receiver devices listening on the same channel will receive it. So you don't have to specify any address.


If you want that the message is sent to any Receiver device you can set the Emitter channel to `-1` (see the channel field description in Emitter documentation [https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/emitter](https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/emitter))

and the next question is it possible to do like multiple independent runs without graphic interface with mac


500 to 1000 runs


(for a scale)

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 03/17/2020 13:54:21
These warnings are caused by the complexity of your simulation model. You may fix them by decreasing the WorldInfo.basicTimeStep or by simplifying your model.

##### tilly 03/17/2020 13:55:50
i have the basic arena + some thymios + 4 floors i need for different ground conditions


where can i do a simplification (changing timesteps didnt fix it)

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 03/17/2020 13:56:27
See hints here to improve your physics simulation to get rid of these warnings: [https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/modeling](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/modeling)


Why do you need 4 floors? Are they superposed?

##### tilly 03/17/2020 13:58:00
for different floor colors


for the ground sensors


yes they are superposed (lay like 0.0001 over the first floor)

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 03/17/2020 13:58:51
Then, you should create a single floor with a texture that matches your need. Such a superposition of floor will likely give you strange results...


For launching series of runs, I would recommend you to start Webots with the `--batch` option, see [https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/starting-webots](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/starting-webots)


And possibly `--minimize` and `--stdout` and `--stderr`.

##### tilly 03/17/2020 14:00:42
Much Thanks. Is there a way to let one run be a fixed time

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 03/17/2020 14:01:22
Yes, simply have a supervisor that will call `wb_supervisor_simulation_quit()` after the fixed time you want.

##### tilly 03/17/2020 14:01:50
Thanks again

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 03/17/2020 14:02:14
You are welcome.

##### tilly 03/17/2020 14:17:44

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 03/17/2020 14:20:10
What do you mean with "doesnt work"? It doesn't quit Webots?


Or do you get a runtime error?

##### tilly 03/17/2020 14:20:26

%end

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 03/17/2020 14:23:21
Yes, this is because it's a non-static member method, therefore, you shouldn't call it with the `Supervisor.` prefix, but with your robot instance as a prefix, e.g., `robot.simulationQuit(0)`

##### tilly 03/17/2020 14:23:39
ok thanks

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 03/17/2020 14:25:33
Because your `robot` variable should be an instance of a `Supervisor`, not a `Robot`


And your `Robot` node (in the Webots world file) should have the `supervisor` field set to `TRUE`.

##### tilly 03/17/2020 14:28:56
thanks, do i need the clean up method in python?

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 03/17/2020 14:31:27
No, it's not needed. It's done automatically when the object is destroyed.


But you can add custom cleanup in the  `__del__` method of the object in Python.


But it is almost never needed.

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 03/17/2020 16:12:18
I will try the debug version tomorrow. In the meantime a noob question: How can I get the position and orientation of my robot's joints? I have tried for an hour, reading the documentation etc. but I can't seem to figure it out. I added a GPS node to the tool slot of my robotic arm, but that just has the position in relation to its own coordinate system, which is useless.

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 03/17/2020 16:13:30
GPS should return you the global X-Y-Z position, is this what you want ?

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 03/17/2020 16:15:16
that or in relation to the base joint. But in general I would like to have access to my joints. Adding GPS sensors in order to read position seems weird. And it doesnt provide orientation

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 03/17/2020 16:16:18
The usual way is to use position sensors: [https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/positionsensor](https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/positionsensor)

Using these sensors you can get the angle/position of the joint

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 03/17/2020 16:16:18
Another thing: creating a new project with the wizard and adding a rectangle arena, the 'up' coordinate is 'y' instead of 'z'. Is there a reason for this?

> Another thing: creating a new project with the wizard and adding a rectangle arena, the 'up' coordinate is 'y' instead of 'z'. Is there a reason for this?

`@Simon Steinmann` Yes, this is the Webots standard, which comes from the VRML standard

ah okay, thank you. I will give it a go üôÇ

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 03/17/2020 16:17:41
About the position and orientation, you may also be interested by the supervisor API to get position and orientation of any node: [https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/supervisor#wb\_supervisor\_node\_get\_position](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/supervisor#wb_supervisor_node_get_position)

This is probably because you are missing a `Makefile.e-puck` file in your controller folder. See for example:

##### tilly 03/19/2020 13:51:03
is it possible to distribute the a certain amount of robots random at the beginning of a simulation run?

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 03/19/2020 13:51:48
You of course, using the supervisor API you can import as many robot as you want and set the loation you want

##### tilly 03/19/2020 13:55:20
is there any example code for adding new robots?

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 03/19/2020 13:56:39
UNfortunately not, but you can import any node using these functions in particular: [https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/supervisor#wb\_supervisor\_field\_import\_mf\_node\_from\_string](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/supervisor#wb_supervisor_field_import_mf_node_from_string)


You will find a very simple example in C for importing a Robot in the root children field.

##### tilly 03/19/2020 14:29:01
Field.importMFNode(FIELD? ,position = -1, filename = "path/to/my/wbofile/Thymio2.wbo") what should i insert by FIELD?

##### Stefania Pedrazzi [cyberbotics] 03/19/2020 14:30:22
you should put the 'children' field of the root object

##### tilly 03/19/2020 14:31:06
got it thanks


after initializing the robots where do i can set the position?

##### Stefania Pedrazzi [cyberbotics] 03/19/2020 14:38:36
you have to retrieve the newly inserted robot using the Supervisor API, then its translation field and using the `setSFVec3f` function you can move it to a new position  [https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/supervisor#wb\_supervisor\_field\_set\_sf\_vec3f](https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/supervisor#wb_supervisor_field_set_sf_vec3f)

##### tilly 03/19/2020 14:41:04
How can i access certain nodes


eg i have 3 thymio2 nodes

##### Stefania Pedrazzi [cyberbotics] 03/19/2020 14:42:18
the simplest way is to retrieve it using the DEF name: [https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/supervisor#wb\_supervisor\_node\_get\_from\_def](https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/supervisor#wb_supervisor_node_get_from_def)


but if all your robots have the same DEF name you can also retrieve them by the position in the parent "children" field: [https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/supervisor#wb\_supervisor\_field\_get\_mf\_node](https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/supervisor#wb_supervisor_field_get_mf_node)

##### tilly 03/19/2020 14:51:32
value = 0.5

        root\_children\_field.getMFNode(11).getField("translation").setMFVec3f(0, value)

        root\_children\_field.getMFNode(11).getField("translation").setMFVec3f(1, value)

        root\_children\_field.getMFNode(11).getField("translation").setMFVec3f(2, value)


something like this


assuming root\_children\_field is where i added the robots and 11 is the number of the node of the robot in the tree

##### Stefania Pedrazzi [cyberbotics] 03/19/2020 14:54:32
yes, but usually a robot translation field is a SFVec3f field and not a MFVec3f.

##### tilly 03/19/2020 14:55:22
much thanks again

how can i lower the complexity of my kuka youbot because i want to simulate more of them and i dont want to get performance issues

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 03/19/2020 16:21:00
Are you using any camera? Are you using the arm of the robot?

##### User21 03/19/2020 16:22:05
iam using the arm and lidar sensors

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 03/19/2020 16:22:44
The first things is to identify where is the bottlneck, physics complexity of the robot or the GPU measure of the lidar.

##### User21 03/19/2020 16:31:02
okay i lowered the frequency of the lida sensory and now its working better. But generally the wheels of the kuka are very complex arent they?

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 03/19/2020 16:32:21
OK, good. About the wheel of the kuka, they actually are not so complex, in Webots we use asymetrical friction as an optimization to simulate omnidirectional wheel, this way the physical complexity of the model is very low.

##### User21 03/19/2020 16:33:31
okay thanks!

##### Hue [cyberbotics] 03/21/2020 14:58:32
You have to set the environment variable WEBOTS\_HOME where your installation folder is at.


you can :

`export WEBOTS_HOME=/path/to/webots`

Also you can append this command to the end of of your ~/.bashrc or ~/.zshrc so the shell will remember it.

Hello, I am working on a 4 wheels robot that can follow a yellow line using light sensors. I am stuck on how to use the light sensors. If there is another better way to make 4 wheels robot follow a yellow line that i will save my life.  I am really a new Webots user. I would really appreciate your helps

##### Tahir [Moderator] 03/21/2020 21:44:19
`@dpimbi` check Adept robots Pioneer,  that is a 4 wheel drive robot but you have to add the sensor. There can also be some other 4 wheel robots already in Webots.

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 03/22/2020 07:59:24
`@dpimbi`, about the sensors, you might use DistanceSensors (whith infra-red type): [https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/distancesensor#infra-red-sensors](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/distancesensor#infra-red-sensors)

Or a camera: [https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/camera](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/camera)

For both option you can find example in Webots.

For DistanceSensors: [https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/epuck#e-puck\_line\_demo-wbt](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/epuck#e-puck_line_demo-wbt)

For camera: [https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots/blob/master/projects/vehicles/worlds/city.wbt](https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots/blob/master/projects/vehicles/worlds/city.wbt)


`@PTosidis`, yes probably, there is nothing platform specific in this plugins.


`@tilly`, how did you install Webots?

Please make sure that the Webots application is in your `PATH` environment variable. Can you please show us the ouput of the `env` command?

##### Jeremy Jiang 03/22/2020 10:37:13

##### Francony 03/23/2020 17:26:40
Hi! I have a Webots Supervisor running a controller that gets the position of every node. When I hit play though my model moves because it is subject to gravity, but I wanted to get the positions without it moving. Is there a way to lock it in place?

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 03/23/2020 17:30:32
Hi! Either you set the WorldInfo.gravity to 0 0 0, or you actively reset the position of every object to its initial value at every step (from the supervisor). Or you remove the Physics node from your objects so that they won't be subject to gravity and other dynamics behaviors.

Can you please try from the command line, following the instructions here:

Just to check if it works this way

##### Tosidis 03/24/2020 08:51:59
running it through webots.bat (instead of webots.exe, and with administrative rights (don't know if it is needed though)) solves the problem

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 03/24/2020 08:52:14
Perfect, very good news.

##### Tosidis 03/24/2020 08:52:30
it was suggested from omichel here : I could reproduce the problem as well, but I noticed that it can be fixed by starting webots.bat instead of webots.exe. This is probably due to the fact the DOS cmd.exe ignores the webots.exe.config file that adds an extra path to the search for shared libraries (e.g., ../../usr/bin).


[https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots/issues/137#issuecomment-457503914](https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots/issues/137#issuecomment-457503914)

It's a standard C programming question, not related with Webots.

##### divya 03/24/2020 14:05:40
tried fprintf, it didnt work in webots


just creates a file but writes nothing in it!

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 03/24/2020 14:06:52
Are you doing this in the main control loop?

##### divya 03/24/2020 14:07:19
yup!

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 03/24/2020 14:07:46
If your code look like this [https://www.javatpoint.com/fprintf-fscanf-in-c](https://www.javatpoint.com/fprintf-fscanf-in-c), then it should work in a Webots controller as well.

##### divya 03/24/2020 14:08:19
it looks exactly like this!

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 03/24/2020 14:08:46
Note: the resulting file will be located in your controller directory, so you must have write rights there so that the file will be created.

oh alright!! i will check the write rights!! thanks for the answers!! üôÇ

##### osiixy 03/25/2020 12:36:12
hi! I use Manjaro and Webots is unable to build controller. During the make process an extra space is added after the WEBOTS\_HOME path (/opt/webots /resources   so after webots in my case), however my path does not contain that extra space (I've checked  and redefined it many time). It seems that it happens in the Makefile, but I cannot figure it out why.

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 03/25/2020 12:39:12
Hi `@osiixy`, we fixed an issue with makefiles adding a spaces in the file a few weeks ago in the development version of Webots: 

[https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots/pull/1304](https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots/pull/1304)

This is not yet released, but you can already get a patched version using the nightly builds to check if this fixes your issue:

[https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots/releases](https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots/releases)

Alternatively, you may also try to simply apply the patch to you local Makefile of your controller.

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 03/25/2020 15:36:55
Hi, you can use the wb\_supervisor\_node\_reset\_physics(robot\_node); See the documentation here: [https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/supervisor-programming](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/supervisor-programming)

##### Laojiang 03/25/2020 15:37:42
ok ,thank you


How can I use this C code 'wb\_supervisor\_node\_reset\_physics(robot\_node)' by python?


I found it ,thank you


I try to use 'Supervisor.simulationResetPhysics(robot)' to reset my robot. However, there is an error:TypeError: in method 'Supervisor\_simulationResetPhysics', argument 1 of type 'webots::Supervisor *'


How can I solve it? or how can I use the code nomally?

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 03/26/2020 07:20:32
Does your `Robot` node have the `supervisor` field set to `TRUE`?


If so, you can use `simulationResetPhysics` like any other robot API function.


(also your robot controller class should be derived from `Supervisor`).


And then you can call `self.simulationResetPhysics(robot)`.


(assuming you are coding your controller in Python).

##### Laojiang 03/26/2020 07:51:22

You should call `robot.simulationResetPhysics(robotNode)`


where `robotNode` points to your robot node.

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 03/26/2020 07:56:55
Your robot object should be a Supervisor instance, not a Robot instance.


Like in `WEBOTS_HOME/projects/languages/python/controllers/driver/driver.py`.


Sorry, my advice was wrong...

##### Laojiang 03/26/2020 08:11:04
Where is wrongÔºüThe .py document?

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 03/26/2020 08:11:21
Instead of calling `robot.simulationResetPhysics(robotNode)`, you should get a pointer to the robot you want to reset physics and call `my_robot.resetPhysics()`


As documented here: [https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/supervisor?tab-language=python#wb\_supervisor\_node\_reset\_physics](https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/supervisor?tab-language=python#wb_supervisor_node_reset_physics)

I have run into a very peculiar issue. For some reason the time required for this timestep increases with each reset. This adds up quickly. In the simulation this manifests itself by requiring many minutes up to hours of simulation time, even though it should only be milliseconds (128 to be exact). Running at real-time-speed, resets would take literally 30min-2h after a little bit

HI `@Simon Steinmann` we are aware of the issue, this is reported here: [https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots/issues/1432](https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots/issues/1432)

We are trying to fix the problem as soon as possible, you can follow this issue to get updates.

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 03/26/2020 09:47:05
Thank you. Is there a workaround in the meantime to reset a simulation without this happening? I'm using it for Reinforcement learning. I have to reset everything without resetting the controller.


perhaps manually moving to an initial position + physics reset?

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 03/26/2020 09:48:03
Yes, you might use this way of resetting manually your robots: [https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/using-numerical-optimization-methods#using-the-wb\_supervisor\_field\_set\_-and-wb\_supervisor\_simulation\_reset\_physics-functions](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/using-numerical-optimization-methods#using-the-wb_supervisor_field_set_-and-wb_supervisor_simulation_reset_physics-functions)

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 03/26/2020 10:21:53
Reseting the physics just means that the velocity of all the Solids will be set to 0, but this will not reset the position. You probably better reset the simulation if you want the robot to be placed at it's initial position, please see:  [https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/using-numerical-optimization-methods#using-the-wb\_supervisor\_world\_reload-function](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/using-numerical-optimization-methods#using-the-wb_supervisor_world_reload-function)

By the way I am adding a warnings in the Webots code that will warn you in the future versions of Webtos if you use this function while the 'supervisor' field is not set to ``TRUE``: [https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots/pull/1501](https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots/pull/1501)

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 03/26/2020 12:26:33
I may have missed something, but I couldnt find the answer in the documentation: How can I fix the base of the robot? I have a robot node with the irb4600-40 proto node in children. As it is a robotic arm, I want to have the base fixed in the world. currently it is wiggling around a bit (as can be seen from the translation and rotation of the children node)

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 03/26/2020 12:48:46
HI `@Simon Steinmann`, in the development version of Webots we added a few weeks ago a new field allowing you to attach the robot to the environment:

[https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots/pull/1349](https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots/pull/1349)

To use this patch you can either copy the patch to your local version of the PROTO or use on of the nightly builds of Webtos including the patch: [https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots/releases](https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots/releases)



Another workaround would be to define a 'boundingObject' for your parent PROTO without physics object.

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 03/26/2020 13:29:51
thank you üôÇ


Is there a reason then, to have the robotic arm proto inside of a generic robot node?

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 03/26/2020 13:32:30
You're welcome.

With the fixed/updated version not anymore, you will just have to set it as root node and set the 'staticBasis' field to ``TRUE``.

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 03/26/2020 13:32:53
root node?

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 03/26/2020 13:33:33
I mean you can remove the parent 'Robot' node and put instead directly the rb4600-40 node.

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 03/26/2020 13:33:48
ah okay, thanks that answer my question üôÇ

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 03/26/2020 13:34:03
You're welcome.

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 03/26/2020 14:05:43
Is there already some sort of implementation for trajectories? Currently I calculate the end position with Inverse Kinematics, however, the PID controller just changes the angles of the motors in proportion to the start and goal angle. This can cause the end effector to crash into the ground, if the new position is a larger positional change. Any Ideas on how to approach this? For example with ROS, Moveit and Gazebo, there is trajectory controllers. Is there anything similar in Webots?

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 03/26/2020 14:10:23
Webots doesn't provide such tool out of the box, but it is very easy to use external libraries executing inverse kinematics, here is an example with the same robot arm that is using the ``ikpy``python  module (this module is used internally by MoveIt too): [https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots/blob/master/projects/robots/abb/irb/controllers/inverse\_kinematics/inverse\_kinematics.py](https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots/blob/master/projects/robots/abb/irb/controllers/inverse_kinematics/inverse_kinematics.py)



And here is an example of the result:



[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jq0-DkEwwj4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jq0-DkEwwj4)

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 03/26/2020 14:42:52
I already implemented IKFast. The issue is not IK itself, but motion planning (trajectories). Meaning not just getting a valid solution vor position B, but the 'how to get from A to B'


Have you interfaced with moveit?


Or if not, if we create a trajectory using moveit for example (a list of joint positions), how would we go about executing these in Webots?


For example: 

Lets say we execute in the webots controller a motors.setPosition(pos) for every timestep, with each position being a waypoint of the trajectory. Would this work? Or would we run into problems with the internal PID controller. To my understanding, it tries to reach that position and then stop, while we want to keep going, after it reaches that position

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 03/26/2020 14:53:22
We have an interface with ROS and therefore MoveIt is available through ROS, however this part is only available for the Universal Robots. But it should be quite simple to extend it to other robotic arms, here is the description: [https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots/tree/master/projects/robots/universal\_robots/resources/ros\_package/ur\_e\_webots](https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots/tree/master/projects/robots/universal_robots/resources/ros_package/ur_e_webots)

The code of the controller providing the ROS interface is available here: [https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots/tree/master/projects/robots/universal\_robots/controllers/universal\_robots\_ros](https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots/tree/master/projects/robots/universal_robots/controllers/universal_robots_ros)

Alternatively, we are currently creating a more powerfull and generic interface with ROS2: [https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots\_ros2](https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots_ros2)

But MoveIt support for ROS2 is still not perfect.

> For example: 

> Lets say we execute in the webots controller a motors.setPosition(pos) for every timestep, with each position being a waypoint of the trajectory. Would this work? Or would we run into problems with the internal PID controller. To my understanding, it tries to reach that position and then stop, while we want to keep going, after it reaches that position

`@Simon Steinmann` this should work, if you make sure to set the position at each step it should work, and even better, if I am not wrong moveit can generate velocity in addition of position, so you can also specify the velocity at each step in Webots in addition of the position.

Hi,

I'm trying to set with PYTHON Webots API the color of led based on the camera readings RGB colors. But I cant manage to find any conversion tool in Webots API that allos to convert RGB readings form



image\_array = camera\_object.getImageArray();

image\_array = [[[116, 55, 35]], [[117, 57, 37]], [[115, 57, 39]]]



Into the HEX format that LED requires ( R8G8B8 ).



Any idea on how this could be accomplished?

Isnt there a :



led\_camera.set(value=[[116, 55, 35])?


Ok I think I gt the answer:


def rgb\_to\_rgbint(rgb):

    r = rgb[0]

    g = rgb[1]

    b = rgb[2]

    rgb = 65536 * r + 256 * g + b

    #value = hex(rgb)

    #value = '0x%02x%02x%02x' % rgb

    return rgb


int\_rgb = rgb\_to\_rgbint((255, 0, 0))

print("HEX VALUE===")

print(int\_rgb)



led\_z\_pos.set(int\_rgb)


We input the int value and seems to work, while if we convert it to hex(int\_rgb) it gives error.

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 03/30/2020 05:39:20
Hi `@[]`, you're solution is pefectly correct indeed.


Even so we usually prefeer this way:

```Python
 rgb = (r << 16) + (g << 8) + b
```

Hey, I need to build a PC that is able to run a simulation with 10 Nao robots playing soccer (see Robocup) close to realtime. What kind of CPU/GPU do you think would be strong enough to make that happen?

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 03/30/2020 11:17:39
Hi, I would recommend a Intel i9-10980XE or AMD Ryzen 9 3950X CPU and a NVIDIA RTX 2080 (or RTX 2070 or GTX 1080 Ti).


Depending on your budget, a slightly more modest configuration may also do the job if your simulation is not too intensive (like not using a high frame rate for high resolution camera images, low physics time step, etc.).


Also, if robot controllers are supposed to run on the same machine, I would prefer a machine with at least 12 virtual cores (which is anyhow the case for the CPUs I just recommended).

##### Tentaculus 03/30/2020 11:27:32
Do you think the AMD Ryzen 9 3900X is a good choice instead? It has 12 cores and is 300$ cheaper than your recommendation

like a fusion cad of a vex robot for example

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 03/30/2020 13:40:07
`@CadenGS`: yes, you need to convert and import such models from your CAD software to Webots.

##### CadenGS 03/30/2020 13:40:23
does it need to be imprted as a certain file type? if so which?

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 03/30/2020 13:40:36
Yes, VRML97.


So, you need to convert each part of your model to VRML97 to create IndexedFaceSet primitives which you can then re-use in Webots.


I would recommend you to follow our tutorials for creating a new robot from scratch.

`@furkann` A bit of background. Webots used to be a commercial product until the version R2019a - reason you are seeing the registration form. After R2019a (R2019a included) Webots is open-source! More about it here:

Hello, i'm building a supervisor controller in python, before I try to get "root = supervisor.getRoot()" like " root = wb\_supervisor\_node\_get\_root(); " in c,   I have to get the "supervisor", but I don't know how to get this.  ("supervisor = robot.getSupervisor()" is not right)

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 03/31/2020 11:54:08
If you want to get the supervisor itself you should use:

```Python
supervisorNode = supervisor.getSelf()
```

##### kwy 03/31/2020 11:56:23
if i try this, there is an error "Only one instance of the Robot class should be created"

%end


how to get the class of "supervisor"

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 03/31/2020 11:57:37
The supervisor class inherits from the robot class, so you should only call:

```
supervisor = Supervisor()
```

And remove the:

```
robot = Robot()
```

You can then use the `supervisor` instance as if it was a `robot` instance

##### kwy 03/31/2020 11:58:09
but i also need "robot.step(8000) "

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 03/31/2020 11:58:39
Then simply replace it by:

```Python
supervisor.step(8000)
```

`@Dorteel` You should set the ``borderRadius``to a smaller value (e.g. 0.002).

About the different pictures, I am not so sure. You probably have to create your own model for this.

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 03/31/2020 14:08:52
`@kwy` I checked your controller and the problem is that in Python the `send` function does accept strings only, you might change your controller like this to send the coordinate as a string:

```Python
from controller import Supervisor

TIME_STEP = 64

supervisor = Supervisor()
# /* get a handler to the emitter and to the robot /
emitter = supervisor.getEmitter("emitter")

# / get the field which contains the position of the robot*/
robot_node = supervisor.getFromDef("GPS_ROBOT")

robot_translation = robot_node.getField("translation")

while supervisor.step(TIME_STEP) != -1:
    robot_coords = robot_translation.getSFVec3f()
    emitter.send("%lf %lf %lf" % (robot_coords[0], robot_coords[1], robot_coords[2]))
```

Or use the Python `struct` module as explained in the Pyton part of the emitter.send function documentation: [https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/emitter?tab-language=python#emitter-functions](https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/emitter?tab-language=python#emitter-functions)

##### ClBaze 03/31/2020 15:05:09

Hi `@w3. eydi`, I wish you healthy days too, thank you.

The blender exporter is indeed supposed to work on Windows, however, for now it does not support versions > 2.7x


`@ClBaze` why aren't you locking the connector from the connector controller directly? From the supervisor you can use the emitter to send a message when the connector need to lock and receive it from the controller of the connector with a receiver.

##### nap 04/01/2020 05:57:38
Sorry but this isn‚Äôt really a technical question.

With the Corvid situation, our ‚ÄòIntro to Robotics‚Äô course has gone online, and because it‚Äôs hard to get components, we‚Äôve decided to use Webots.

My question is: does anyone know if/where I might be able to download a working ePuck project that will work with the currently available Webots binaries?


Ideally it would use more than the GSM module.

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 04/01/2020 06:00:06
You will find some example using the e-puck here: [https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/epuck#samples](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/epuck#samples)

`@David Mansolino` thank you, the thing is that my scene contains a lot of robots (>36) with each robot having 6 connectors. Attaching a controller to each connector will really slow down the simulation I think. So the idea was to have a unique controlleur using a supervisor to lock/unlock the connectors

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 04/01/2020 07:17:07
Ok, in that case have you tried to swithc the 'autoLock' field? Make also sure that the distance, axis and rotation tolerance are big enough.

##### ClBaze 04/01/2020 08:06:37
Our connectors are not supposed to be magnetic, so I've set the autoLock to False. I've just increased the distance, axis and rotation tolerances but the problem persists. I figured out that if I run the simulation, save the scene and reload it the connector are well connected.

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 04/01/2020 08:11:02
I am sorry, I just checked in the code, but changing the lock field while the simulation is running is not yet supported (it is supported only when the simulation is started), if you need this feature, please open an issue here and the development team will try to implement this as soon as possible: [https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots/issues/new?template=feature\_request.md](https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots/issues/new?template=feature_request.md)

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 04/02/2020 12:04:11

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 04/02/2020 13:04:17
Hi this is probably a physics instability that makes the robot explode.


To check what is hapenning it is recomended to use the step by step mode to see exactly when and how/why it does explode.


One possible solution is to decrease the simulation step.

How can I build new motion files like those?


I want to control Nao to recognize and grasp a ball in Webots.


Python

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 04/03/2020 05:29:16
Hi `@monkey` , please make sure to install the latest drivers of you GPU and retry launching Webots.


`@luhang`, you might copy paste one of them and modify it by opening the file in a text editor. However, I would rather recommend to use directly the Webots motor API to control the motors:  [https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/motor](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/motor)

##### [] 04/03/2020 07:59:20
Having a strange issue. When I launch my controller for the first time, I check that all the cameras are working and start my controller loop. It finishes, everything went ok. But when I re-execute the controller again, the cameras don't get any data. In the visualisers in webots the cameras are working, but I just don't get the camera data, its None. I'm using python and executing the controller externally. I'm also disabling the cameras before finishing the controller loop. Only when I reload the world that I can launch again the controller without issues.

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 04/03/2020 08:06:50
Hi `@[]`, the scenario you are describing should work, however I have to admit that it was never tested, may I ask you to open an issue here: [https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots/issues/new?template=bug\_report.md](https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots/issues/new?template=bug_report.md)

Hi! We're planning on doing a social experiment with the NAO robot from SoftBank, where users should be able to personalize the robot by setting colour schemes. Is it possible to set the body colour/material of the robot from white? To modify the built-in proto file?

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 04/03/2020 09:31:20
Sure.


That should be pretty straightforward when you look into the PROTO file. If you have any problem let us know.

##### Dorteel 04/03/2020 10:35:48
Thank you, I managed to change it, but I have a problem with the wrists. I saw they have their own proto file, is it possible to change the colour of those when changing the main colour in the original proto file?

By original I mean Nao's proto file

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 04/03/2020 10:37:49
Yes, but you will need to add an extra parameter to the wrist proto file, named `bodyColor` or so.


(in addition to the existing `color` field)


And pass the correct color from the original Nao proto.

##### jmroa0 04/03/2020 13:52:27
Hello folks. I'm new to Webots and have a quick question. I'd like to use the platform to run experiments involving self driving autonomous vehicles. 

I'm looking for an open source example of a AI based car that can run in Webots. Basically the AI code car would get camera images, lidar etc from 

Webots and then send commands to drive the car around in the simulated world. Is there such a thing available? If so can you point me in the right direction?

Thanks a lot for your help!

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 04/03/2020 13:55:32
Hi `@jmroa0` we have a very simple example of autonomous simulation in Webots which is open-source (of course many of our clients have created their own IA to drive the car which are way more efficient and complex, but unfortunately they are close-source). Here is the sample: [https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/automobile/city](https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/automobile/city)

Here is the Webots project sources: [https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots/tree/master/projects/vehicles](https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots/tree/master/projects/vehicles)

This sample is available in Webots out of the box with the standard installation.


If you haven't yet followed our tutorial, I strongly recommend to follow at least tutorial 1-6: [https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/tutorials](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/tutorials)


you will learn how your car controller can get camera, lidar, etc inputs and act on the car control.

##### jmroa0 04/03/2020 13:58:36
Thanks David. I'm working through the tutorials. They are very good! Do you know of people in academia using Webots for autonomous vehicle experiments? they tend to be more willing to share their code etc.

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 04/03/2020 14:01:54
I have been working closely with the EPFL university to do autonomous vehicle simulations in Webots, unfortunately I can't share this code either. But I can point you to some of the publications:

[https://www.epfl.ch/labs/disal/research/NetworkedIV/](https://www.epfl.ch/labs/disal/research/NetworkedIV/)

##### jmroa0 04/03/2020 14:03:57
Awesome. After the tutorials, and the "out the box" example, I'll review these papers. Hopefully they have put some of the code in GitHub. Thanks again for your prompt and helpful responses!

`@Rajesh Roy` there is [https://robotbenchmark.net/](https://robotbenchmark.net/) so it does appear to be technically possible but I can't speak to how it is achieved


`@Shadow` you can filter by colour, it doesn't offer an IR option but depending on your use case you could use some other colour instead of IR


I.e. use red instead of infrared


`@yash` I believe that you will need to use a fog node in your environment to simulate atmospheric effects if you want objects to get fainter with distance

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 04/06/2020 05:26:29
> Hi, can I create

`@ksardias` You should probably use distance-sensors and set the type to ``sonar`` and increase the numberOfRays to something like 3-5. See more information here: [https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/distancesensor#distancesensor-types](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/distancesensor#distancesensor-types)


> `@David Mansolino` I updated my graphics driver but I am still getting the white screen. I even tried messing with the OpenGL preferences. Literally everything else is working even the sound.

In that case you should probably try with the safe mode of Webots enabled: [https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/distancesensor#distancesensor-typesebots](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/distancesensor#distancesensor-typesebots) enabled: 

`@monkey`


> Is there any way of having a thermal camera sensor?

`@Shadow` Unfortunately this is not available out of the box in Webots.


> And is there any sort of sensors for detecting colour, some sort of light sensor.

`@Shadow` why not using a camera? you can set it's resolution to 1x1.

Webots also provide a light sensor, but it is not very useful to detect color: [https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/distancesensor#distancesensor-types](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/distancesensor#distancesensor-types)

Alternatively, you can use the distance-sensor of type ``infra-red`` which are impacted by the color of the object: [https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/distancesensor#distancesensor-types](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/distancesensor#distancesensor-types)


> Hello, I'm using "pen" to draw trail. but I'm confused ,when I change the size of the arena, why does the trail  disappear and "pen" no longer draws trail ?

`@kwy` It is difficult to say without looking at your simulation, may I ask you to open an issue (including your world file) here: [https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots/issues/new?template=bug\_report.md](https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots/issues/new?template=bug_report.md)

Thank you


> Why front left get wrong value?

`@ksardias` it seems you are using the Khepera 4 robot right? If yes, the distance sensors of the Khepera 4 are infra-red distance sensors, which means that they are influenced by the material of the object they are seeing. May I ask you to retry with a white box with a roughness of 0?

For more information about the infra-red distance sensors, please see: [https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/distancesensor#infra-red-sensors](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/distancesensor#infra-red-sensors)


> I am using a camera to detect coloured objects , should the RGB values differ if the robot is far or near the object ?

`@yash` 

If you have no fog node, their is indeed no reason for them to differ.

`@Rajesh Roy` yes this is possible.

You are lucky Webots does provide a web interface. If I where you I would create my simulation as a Webots simulation in a first step and then use the web interface of Webots to be able to share it throught a web page. As a first step I would start by playing with the mavic simulation in Webots that is probably the closest setup to what you are aiming for: [https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/mavic-2-pro](https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/mavic-2-pro) Once you're happy with the simulation in Webots you may find interesting information about how to move it to the web here: [https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/web-interface](https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/web-interface)


`@Simon Steinmann`, you will have to implement inverse kinematic to do cartesian control with a robotic arm, we have one example distributed within Webots, this example use the an ABB robotic arm and the ikpy python library to do inverse kinematic: From what I understood you have to provide a web simulation.

`@ƒ∞chigogo` What you did should work, what is the exact error message you get? Can you try if this controller works for you (as it uses the exact same file hierarchy): [https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots/tree/master/projects/samples/devices/controllers/speaker](https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots/tree/master/projects/samples/devices/controllers/speaker)

Is it possible to export solidworks design robot prototype to webots?

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 04/07/2020 08:22:10
From solidworks you can export to VRMl and then import this VRML to Webots, this will import all the shape, you will then have to re-create the hierarchy, bounding objects and joints.


Here is an example with autodesk: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0FVsFD2rS4&feature=youtu.be](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0FVsFD2rS4&feature=youtu.be)

I don't think I can write the safe mode in the Webots variable unfortunately

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 04/07/2020 12:47:52

##### Francony 04/07/2020 12:54:56
Hi, I'm analyzing a robot on webots, but the overall mass of the robot is wrong. I see that there are masses under the Physics field of a node. My question is: is there another part where there could be masses? For example, I have a motor node with a Shape field that says "USE MOTOR" but there's no mass to be seen anywhere (tell me if what I wrote is too confusing). Thanks in advance.

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 04/07/2020 12:55:43
Hi `@Francony` each Solid node can have a Physics node and therfore its own mass, but Shape node are just visual, no physics

##### Francony 04/07/2020 12:59:37
Ah I see thanks. My main Supervisor (Robot) has a physics node and mass of 0.389. This is the sum of all the masses of the physics nodes of its children?

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 04/07/2020 13:00:29
No, this is just for the root node, if the node has Solid nodes in tis children fields the total mass is the sum of all the individual masses.

##### Francony 04/07/2020 13:02:07
ohhhhh okay. I'm gonna add them all up then and see if they match. Thanks a lot!

Hi `@thomas5mc` I guess you are trying to do the first step code tutorial from the documentation...

Here is a translated example of the c controller:

```python
from controller import Supervisor

# create a supervisor instance
supervisor = Supervisor()

# get the time step of the current world.
timestep = int(supervisor.getBasicTimeStep())

# retrieve concerned robot node from supervisor
robot_node = supervisor.getFromDef("MY_ROBOT")

# retrieve concerned field from robot node
translation_field = robot_node.getField("translation")

while supervisor.step(timestep) != -1:
    # retrieve and print values from translation field repeatedly
    res = translation_field.getSFVec3f()
    print("MY_ROBOT is at position:", res[0], res[1], res[2])

how can I solve it? I didn't change the image format

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 04/08/2020 08:35:32
The name of the library is `libjpeg-8.dll`. It is located in `C:\Program Files\Webots\msys64\mingw64\bin` and Webots should use it. However, it seems your system as another version of this `libjpeg-8.dll` in a folder pointer to by your `PATH` environment variable and Webots uses it wrongly instead of using its own version. You should find this wrong library on your system and remove its path from your `PATH` environment variable or rename (temporarily) this conflicting library.

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 04/08/2020 10:13:41
Instead of `C:\Users\...`? So, that would mean the problem arises when Webots is installed in the local user folder, but not when Webots is installed for all users (in `C:\Program Files\Webots`)?

Is there a way to stop execution of commands without stopping the whole simulation? My goal is to give my robot enough time to move its motors before going onto the next instruction. I have tried time.sleep but that just pauses the whole simulation and has no effect on the end result

##### Darko Lukiƒá [cyberbotics] 04/08/2020 20:51:08
`@JC` You need to call `robot.step(timestep)` periodically, e.g.:

```py
# Set motor velocity at e.g. 1 radian per second
motor.setVelocity(1)

# Let the motor move for a while
# The loop will create a pause of 10*timestep[ms]
for _ in range(10)
    robot.step(timestep)

# Do the other command...
```

The default value of RotationalMotor.maxTorque is 10 ,need I to increase it?

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 04/09/2020 08:13:45
It depends on your model, if it is heavy, with high friction, it may be needed to increase it.

##### Laojiang 04/09/2020 08:15:35
ok, I'll try it, thank you


My model can move now. However, I found that my both soft (minPosition and maxPosition) and hard limits (minStop and maxStop) don't do anything during  the model moving.


In fact, it looks that the moving can break in the limits easily

This PROTO here is doing exactly what you want to do: [https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots/blob/69202baee3c0974f69f0e72d3412d19ed69feaad/projects/objects/traffic/protos/DirectionPanel.proto](https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots/blob/69202baee3c0974f69f0e72d3412d19ed69feaad/projects/objects/traffic/protos/DirectionPanel.proto)

When the ``text`` field changes it generates a new image in the temporary files and then use it as texture.

hello, is there any sensor detect landmarks ?

##### nap 04/10/2020 16:02:06
I would not think so, since a landmark can be anything.


You need to configure your sensor analysis code to detect when a landmark is being sensed.


If you mean GPS or cartesian coordinates, then you need to know where you are and test whether you're at the landmark.


If you're using vision, then you need some algorithm that is able to determine if it sees the landmark.

##### Techcore 04/10/2020 21:27:47
Hi! I hope someone can help me üôÇ how do I set the wheel position sensor to zero or any other value ??    leftWheelSensor.getValue()

##### kwy 04/11/2020 02:41:30
`@nap` thanks .


`@nap` So can I divide the map into simple geometric areas, or convert map into matrix. And then find the location of the robot and landmarks on the map. Is this effective?



using vision can I get the information about the range and bearing?

##### nap 04/11/2020 07:03:36
`@kwy` Essentially, that would be a good approach if you're using some coordinate system.  Obviously you will/can check where the robot is and compare it to your map.

In order to get bearing/range information, your vision system will need to recognise things and provide that information.  Then you could use the 'triangulation' principle to see where you are, in which case you will usually fall back to a Cartesian coordinate system.


`@Techcore` , good question.  One way to deal with the problem would be to record the value and compare the difference later?

##### kwy 04/11/2020 07:53:08
`@nap` It that possible to build a plugin which can recognise a  simple landmarks and provide bearing/range information. The landmarks can be very simple, like a green point on the wall.

##### nap 04/11/2020 08:07:15
You would probably do that in your "Controller".  Sensors are generally NOT smart;  they just provide the data.


(That is how I program my controllers.)


So, the camera provides a frame to your controller and your controller scans the frame to see if there is a green spot.  if there is, then do action A, otherwise continue doing action B.

`@zynp` 

Make sure your object's `recognitionColors` field is not empty:

[https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/recognition?tab-language=python#description](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/recognition?tab-language=python#description)


> hello, is there any sensor detect landmarks ?

`@kwy` 

If you want to evaluate your landmark detection algorithms (that can be scaled to the real-world) you can use ArUco Markers ([https://docs.opencv.org/trunk/d5/dae/tutorial\_aruco\_detection.html](https://docs.opencv.org/trunk/d5/dae/tutorial_aruco_detection.html)). OpenCV allows you to get position and rotation of the ArUco Markers, so you can use it to determine range and bearing. 



Otherwise, you can use Webots Recognition node. Just make sure to follow the instructions:

- [https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/recognition](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/recognition)

- [https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/camera?tab-language=python#wb\_camera\_has\_recognition](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/camera?tab-language=python#wb_camera_has_recognition)

`@Troy` the physics plugins are loaded directly in Webots (not like the controller which are separated executables) which means that if your plugin has an issue an crashes, it will make Webots crash too.

`@Zuxin` internal nodes of a PROTO node can't be manipulated, but you might reset the robot using the wb\_supervisor\_node\_reset\_physics function ([https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/supervisor?version=develop#wb\_supervisor\_node\_reset\_physics](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/supervisor?version=develop#wb_supervisor_node_reset_physics))

`@Jeremy Jiang` the uneven terrain PROTO uses internally the ElevationGrid node: [https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/elevationgrid](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/elevationgrid)

Using this node you can create a floor with any custom eleveation (based on a regularly spaced grid).

> Hi, I want to make my own ROS controller. However, 'import rospy' doesnt work in a new controller, it only works when changing the existing universal\_robot\_ros controller. Any ideas as to why?

`@Simon Steinmann` this is because this controller contains a ``runtime.ini`` files that adds the rospy libraries to the path, see: [https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots/blob/master/projects/robots/universal\_robots/controllers/universal\_robots\_ros/runtime.ini](https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots/blob/master/projects/robots/universal_robots/controllers/universal_robots_ros/runtime.ini)

> I want a synchronous controller in webots, for this I need a loop running, and only execute robot.step(timestep) when I give the command. How can I accomplish this. Is it possible inside webots, or do I HAVE to go the extern controller route?

`@Simon Steinmann` this is indeed possible inside Webots, but you have to make sure that you have a callback (for example from a ROS service) that calls the ``robot.step(timestep)`` function.

> I need help to create an account

`@ITS11` Webots does not require any account anymore, you can use any email address you want and the generic 'webots' password, for more information see:

[https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/general-faq#can-i-still-use-a-webots-version-before-the-r2019a-release](https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/general-faq#can-i-still-use-a-webots-version-before-the-r2019a-release)

Note also that we do recommend to use the latest version of Webots which doesn't require to login anymore.


> Hi, can we get robot1's sensor information (such as camera) in robot2's controller using python? For example, I want to use a centralized controller to gather all the robots sensor information and send move commands to other robots' controller..

`@Zuxin` you need to use emitter and receiver to send/share these information.


> In Webots R2020a-rev1, I don't seem to be getting any noise in the motors and my epuck drives striaght without needing any control.  Is there a setting that turns on noise?

`@nap` Webots does not provide noise in motor command.

##### nap 04/15/2020 06:01:27
`@David Mansolino` :  So, given a differential robot and symmetric motor commands, the robot travels in a perfectly straight line on a flat/level surface?  (I don't think that was the case in Webots 7/8)

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 04/15/2020 06:13:55
Yes it does. On Webots 7, the kinematic version had indeed a noise feature you're right, but since these robots are now dynamic for most of them this is not supported anymore. But since it might indeed be a good idea to have noise on the motor command, feel free to open an a feature request here: [https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots/issues/new?template=feature\_request.md](https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots/issues/new?template=feature_request.md)

Hello guys, How can I control a webots simulation via Qt Widget application.

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 04/15/2020 06:46:17
Hi, you can simply write a Qt application that includes webots C or C++ include files and is linked with the Webots libController library.


Your Qt application should however call the `wb_robot_step` on a regular basis (for example called by QTimer callback) to make the simulation advance.

> Your Qt application should however call the `wb_robot_step` on a regular basis (for example called by QTimer callback) to make the simulation advance.

`@Olivier Michel` Thank you so much for your interest

##### nap 04/15/2020 08:06:47
`@David Mansolino` : Thanks.  I'll take you up on that suggestion.  I was planning on making an introductory exercise for my students, but with no noise, I'll work out some other scenarios.

Is there a way of inducing noise?  (I don't want the students to simply disable it and then say "Look my project works".  lol

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 04/15/2020 08:26:49
You may add artificial noise on the controller side, but this is indeed easy to disable for the students. 

Otherwise, you can rather add noise on the sensor side, most of the sensors in Webots do provide a noise model.

##### nap 04/15/2020 08:45:07
`@David Mansolino` :  (1) I was thinking about this after I posted my question.  I suppose if the students work out how to disable the noise they can easily work out how to implement a feedback loop for this.

(2) Our students will be installing their own Webots versions based on the OS they have.  So I would need to supply them with our version of the sensor model.

 BTW, where would the sensor noise model be implemented?  Would it be in the controller as well or in a different part of the project (I have no idea atm.)

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 04/15/2020 08:46:12
For the sensors, this is defined directly in the Webots scene-tree (or can be hidden in a PROTO file if you want to hide this to your student).

##### nap 04/15/2020 08:47:26
`@David Mansolino` : ok.  So it would be 'given to them' but in such a way that it would be 'obfuscated'?

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 04/15/2020 08:47:28
For example for distance sensors, this is defined in the look-up table: [https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/distancesensor#lookup-table](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/distancesensor#lookup-table)


> `@David Mansolino` : ok.  So it would be 'given to them' but in such a way that it would be 'obfuscated'?

`@nap` Yes exactly. Of course they can always manually edit the PROTO file a text editor, but this way more tricky.

##### nap 04/15/2020 08:48:22
We're not going into details about PROTOs, though I've mentioned they exist.


`@David Mansolino` :  Cheers, that sounds like something interesting for me to learn how to do. (And thanks for the link/example.)

##### machinekoder 04/15/2020 10:04:30
What's the best way to simulate a light source emitted from a plane? In particular an LED strip.

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 04/15/2020 10:06:28
You should probably set some emissive color to the material of that plane.


See [https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/material](https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/material)

##### machinekoder 04/15/2020 11:19:59
`@Olivier Michel` I tried that, but it doesn't change the illumination of surrounding objects.

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 04/15/2020 11:21:47
This is normal. To change the illumination of surrounding objects, you should setup lights in your environment.


[https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/light](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/light)


I guess you will have to tune the `ambientIntensity` parameter and `location` or  `direction` depending on the type of light you will select.

##### nap 04/15/2020 12:01:02
`@David Mansolino` : I've looked at the E-puck.proto file, and whilst it is possible to add noise to the positional sensors, the follow-line behaviour does not use that information.  Instead it uses the GSM module to detect the line and simply sends differential motor commands.  I don't want to introduce more noise on the GSM as that will throw the control loop out.  RotationalMotors however does not allow a noise parameter.

Just thinking aloud here.  If I were to introduce a "Brake" device, with some friction coefficient, can noise be introduced there?

Are there any callbacks I could subscribe to in order to fiddle the motor commands?


Is the power of the wheels affected by the battery state?  Can there be some noise introduced there?


I assume the simulation is based on rigid bodies, can I introduce something between the motor and the epuck body that varies the position/orientation of the wheel randomly?

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 04/15/2020 12:07:06
Webots API does not include any callback, but you might introduce some in the controller.

About the Brake, it will work if you control the motor in torque, if you use speed control, the PID controller will compensate for the brake (util it reaches the maximum torque).

About the battery, it will unfortunately switch on/or the motor but not influence the commands.


> I assume the simulation is based on rigid bodies, can I introduce something between the motor and the epuck body that varies the position/orientation of the wheel randomly?

`@nap` yes it is indeed, yes that's a possibility.

##### nap 04/15/2020 12:07:53
What kind of device could I insert into the chain?


does Webots model super-balls?

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 04/15/2020 12:08:30
But maybe if you really want to introduce some 'randomness' in your simulation the simplest solution is to use a second controller using the Supervisor API which will perturbate the robot (by adding some random force/torque on the robot for example).


> does Webots model super-balls?

`@nap` What so you mean by super-balls?

##### nap 04/15/2020 12:09:07
I've never used a Supervisor.  We had an Educational License for W7/8.  üò¶

> lol, one of those balls kids play with that bounces really well and high.

`@nap` not really, but you can have a ball and tune the contact properties to make bouncy.

##### nap 04/15/2020 12:10:33
Yes, and I'm very happy that I have access, I think Webots is a terrific development and look forward to a bright future.

`@kwy`, the `supervisor_draw_trail.wbt` world looks handy for my situation.  It has an epuck and a supervisor in it together.


In the draw trail, how does the supervisor get a reference to the Epuck?

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 04/15/2020 12:44:49
It gets it from the 'TARGET' DEF name: [https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots/blob/master/projects/samples/howto/controllers/supervisor\_draw\_trail/supervisor\_draw\_trail.c#L72](https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots/blob/master/projects/samples/howto/controllers/supervisor_draw_trail/supervisor_draw_trail.c#L72)

##### nap 04/15/2020 12:46:12
I can see that it creates the Trail shape, but I'm not seeing how it know to draw it where to epuck has been.


Yep, I see


Does DEF TARGET need to be globally unique in the world?


and if I wanted to get a reference to the Epuck, I would use "PROTO E-puck"?

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 04/15/2020 12:49:27
> Does DEF TARGET need to be globally unique in the world?

`@nap` Yes.

##### nap 04/15/2020 12:49:52

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 04/15/2020 12:50:09
> and if I wanted to get a reference to the Epuck, I would use "PROTO E-puck"?

`@nap` No, you have to add a DEF name to your e-puck and then use the same in the Supervisor controller: [https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/def-and-use](https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/def-and-use)

##### nap 04/15/2020 12:50:47
Ok, would that be done by editing the PROTO file?


Or attaching it to the turret?


(turret slot?  [Which is a collection])

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 04/15/2020 12:52:13
Non, when you select the node in Webots, you can define the DEF name in the node editor (just below the scene-tree): [https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/def-and-use](https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/def-and-use)

##### nap 04/15/2020 12:52:47
Ok, ic.  (actually seen it a lot but never understood its real meaning.)


I'll have a look at the python master/slave project now that can see roughly how it works.

`@David Mansolino` :  It would be nice to be able to open two Webots windows. (Not to run in both, but to compare.)


hmmm.  `@David Mansolino` :  I decided to use a Physics Plugin.

So I edited the E-puck PROTO and added a DEF leftHinge to the HingeJoint (same for the right side).

Set the physics node in WorldInfo to my plugin name.  In the plugin C file, I have defined a `dBodyID` for each joint in the init() method using `epuckHinges[0] = dWebotsGetBodyFromDEF("epuckLeftHinge");`.  And in the step() method, I have `dBodyAddForce(epuckHinges[0], 0.0, 0.0, 9.0);` for each hinge (-9.0 for the other one.); spin around the Z axis.

But my epuck still goes straight.


I'm using the (mistake) actually it's the `flying_mybot.c` example as a rough guide.

Why does the Y axis point up into the sky?  Should that not be the Z axis?


Anyone know much about Physics Plugins and the library functions available?


`@David Mansolino` : I did it.  It looks crap but it works.  I ended up using a Physics Plugin, but had to resort to dBodyGetRotation and dBodySetRotation because I couldn't get dBodyAddRelTorque and dBodyAddRelForce to work for some reason.

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 04/16/2020 05:30:11
The Y axis pointing to the sky is a standard in VRML97 from which Webots inherited. I know RViz and other software more often use Z as the vertical axis. We are considering changing this into Webots, but that will take quite some time.

If each robot has 4 cameras, this is probably the bottleneck. Cameras are expensive to simulate or the GPU, you should either try with a more powerful GPU either try reducing the camera refresh rates.

Hello, I have a problem with Webots. Every time when I create the ElevatorGrid node within the solid node, the Webots will breakdown, and I cannot find the solution. I'm using the version of webots-R2020a-rev2. Is the problem related to this version, could you tell me the suggestions?

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 04/17/2020 07:43:57
Please open a bug report allowing us to reproduce the crash.

##### Francony 04/17/2020 08:59:35
Hi, is there a way to automatically add all Bounding object based inertial matrices to my nodes so that they are accessible from a controller?

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 04/17/2020 09:00:51
Yes, if you don't specify the inertial matrices, they are automatically computed from the bounding object.

##### Francony 04/17/2020 09:03:31
Thanks for the quick answer. Thats what I thought but when I don't add them in manually and use "inertiaMatrix.getMFVec3f(0)" I get a "called with an out-of-bound index: 0" error, should I be accessing them differently?

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 04/17/2020 09:04:51
Yes, if they are not present in the scene tree, you cannot retrieve them from a supervisor...

##### Francony 04/17/2020 09:05:46
okay, thats what I was wondering from my first question, I wasn't clear. Thanks a lot and have a nice day.

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 04/17/2020 09:06:26
There is an API function for getting the center of mass: [https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/supervisor#wb\_supervisor\_node\_get\_center\_of\_mass](https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/supervisor#wb_supervisor_node_get_center_of_mass)


But unfortunately none for getting the inertia matrix. Nevertheless it shouldn't be very difficult to implement it. If you want to dig into the source code of Webots and implement it, you are very welcome!

##### nap 04/17/2020 09:53:22
In the physics plugin with an E-Puck robot, setting `dBodySetRotation(gRobotBodyID, body_posr.R);` rotates the body, but the wheels come off (that is they do not rotate with the body).  It would appear to me that this has something to do with how the `E-puck.proto` is defined.  Is that so?

##### Francony 04/17/2020 12:44:01
Hi, just out of curiousity, I have a children field with one node in it. When I used .getField("children").getSFNode() it didn't find it, but .getField("children").getMFNode(0) found it. Is there something i'm missing here?

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 04/17/2020 12:46:31
`@Francony` even if you have only one node in the children field this field type is still a MFNode so you should use   getMFNode.

getSFNode is reserved for SFNode (such as for example the ``phyiscs`` field of the ``Solid`` nodes).

##### Francony 04/17/2020 12:47:26
makes sense, thanks!

##### Soyboy 04/17/2020 15:24:32
Hi guys, I just started using Webots about a week ago and I'm trying to make a shape using IndexedFaceSet. I made all the points and indexes and the shape is there but each face is only visible from certain angles. Does anyone know what is causing this and/or how to fix it?

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 04/17/2020 15:26:11
That's because faces are single sided. If you need double sided faces, you should define them twice, but with reverse vertex order in the second time.


However, I would recommend you to use a 3D modeling software to create complex IndexedFaceSet nodes, such as Blender.

##### nap 04/18/2020 09:52:10
Q about the Physics in Webots.... I'm trying to simulate some noise in the motors/wheels in the epuck (differential robot).  I've tried a few ways so far and right now I'm attempting to alter the course of the epuck using `dBodySetAngularVel`.  I'm setting the y (yaw) parameter to some value that generates an effect.  Then, every 50 steps, I'm flipping the sign on the yaw parameter, which in theory should create a zig-zag path.  However this is not happening and I'm cannot understand why.  Attached is a video that demonstrates my point:  [https://abms.net.au/public/physics\_angular\_velocity\_oil\_slick\_then\_tar.mp4](https://abms.net.au/public/physics_angular_velocity_oil_slick_then_tar.mp4)

The name of the video says it all.


The code for the physics plugin is at: [https://abms.net.au/public/worldPhysicsC.c.zip](https://abms.net.au/public/worldPhysicsC.c.zip)


This behaviour doesn't seem to make sense to me.


Can someone please explain the 4x3 matrix returned from a call to `dBodyGetRotation`?  I know that elements 3, 7, and 11 are to be ignored.  My understanding is that the diagonal of the matrix (0, 5,10) represent the rotation about the X, Y, Z axis respectively.  What I don't understand is the purpose/meaning of the other matrix elements; 1,2,4,6,8,9.  My understanding is that those elements represent coupling between axis, but a body rotation should not have these.  Unless the matrix includes information about inertial, or the body is being distorted around axis?

##### nap 04/19/2020 14:50:45
`@Simon Steinmann` :  Thanks.  I will read it.  Does the tutorial use the same conventions as Webots?


(and ODE?)

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 04/19/2020 14:53:01
it is linear Algebra. The math is the same, no matter what software you use


it is not 100% necessary to understand it, but it certainly helps. There is conversion libraries, to convert things like rotations from one form into another. The 3 most commonly used rotation notations are Quaternion (x,y,z, w). Euler Angles and 3x3 Rotation matrix. They all have andvantages and disadvantages


An incredible link to understand Quaternion is this: [https://eater.net/quaternions/](https://eater.net/quaternions/)

##### nap 04/19/2020 14:59:43
I'm  not new to 3D transformations, it's just that I don't use them everyday, and there are things happening in Webots which don't seem to make sense.  Like, when my epuck is facing up the screen (-Z), I can make it yaw by using  `dRFromAxisAndAngle(R,0.0,1.0,0.0, dBodyRobotRot[2] - angleDeltaBase);` followed by `dBodySetRotation(gLeftWheelBodyID,R);`

However, when I have the epuck facing Left on the screen (-X), I cannot use the same formula.  It doesn't make sense because I'm still performing a yaw.


(Thanks for your suggestions though.)

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 04/19/2020 15:01:00
everything depends on your reference frame. Usually every joint and the world have their own coordinate systems, and it is not always clear, which way they 'point'

##### nap 04/19/2020 15:01:34
From the docs, dBodyGetRotation return world coords.


and can be used in dBodySetRotation


So, I get the orientation, add a small yaw and then set the new orientation.


At least that's what I want to do.

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 04/19/2020 15:02:40
for rotating a bot, it usually makes sense to use its own frame

##### nap 04/19/2020 15:03:21
I get the bot's current orientation using  `dBodyRobotRot = (dReal *) dBodyGetRotation(gRobotBodyID);`


I suppose I should calculate the X-Z angle.

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 04/20/2020 16:16:17
Hi, is there a simple way to publish the odometry into a ros topic from within webots? The only way I can think of right now is to use supervisor with getPosition() and geOrientation(), to then convert the orientation matrix to Quaternion and to manually construct a Pose message and publish it. Is there a simpler way?

##### Darko Lukiƒá [cyberbotics] 04/20/2020 16:20:17
`@Simon Steinmann`  If you use ROS2 than you can use `WebotsDifferentialDriveNode` in your ROS2 driver. You can check a good example of `WebotsDifferentialDriveNode` usage here:

[https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots\_ros2/blob/471430ae85beb4524f9db83b971b132fb5aa7a04/webots\_ros2\_tiago/webots\_ros2\_tiago/tiago\_controller.py#L25](https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots_ros2/blob/471430ae85beb4524f9db83b971b132fb5aa7a04/webots_ros2_tiago/webots_ros2_tiago/tiago_controller.py#L25)

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 04/20/2020 16:20:42
using ROS1 sadly


and I'm using a robot arm, I basically want the position and orientation of the endeffektor relativ to the robot itself


with the orientation being in quaternion


How can i get the position and orientation relative to a different frame? I dont want it relative to the world. In the GUI I can select it, but I want to set it by code.


basically I want to set this, but from within my controller. And I want to get the Rotation in Quaternion as shown in the pic.

##### Darko Lukiƒá [cyberbotics] 04/20/2020 18:57:05
`@Simon Steinmann` Oh, odometry is usually used in the context of mobile robots. I didn't know you use industrial robots. `tf` is a package that you want to check out. `tf` allows you to get transformation (translation and rotation) between any two links in a transform tree. 



To see all available published transformations, you can use:

```
rostopic echo /tf
```

This is one of many ways, you can use e.g. RViz or check the following page for more examples:

[http://wiki.ros.org/tf](http://wiki.ros.org/tf)



As mentioned, `tf` can calculate any transformation in the given transform tree, so you can use:

```
rosrun tf tf_echo [link_1] [link_2]
```

so, e.g. you can can obtain transformation between `upper_arm_link` and `wrist_1_link` as:

```
$ rosrun tf tf_echo /upper_arm_link /wrist_1_link
At time 152.976
- Translation: [0.000, -0.137, 1.184]
- Rotation: in Quaternion [0.000, 0.707, 0.000, 0.707]
            in RPY (radian) [3.142, 1.571, 3.142]
            in RPY (degree) [180.000, 89.998, 180.000]
At time 152.976
```



How to code it? With an understanding of everything above it is relatively easy to code. Please check an example here:

[http://wiki.ros.org/tf2/Tutorials/Writing%20a%20tf2%20listener%20%28C%2B%2B%29](http://wiki.ros.org/tf2/Tutorials/Writing%20a%20tf2%20listener%20%28C%2B%2B%29)

If the simulation is not running anymore it means that Webots is waiting for the controller, which means that your controller is not calling the robot.step function anymore.

`@Olivier Michel` I tried your suggestions, but they did not work.  When I launched Webots this morning, it was behaving correctly, but when I launched it this afternoon, the 3D View was blank again.  I did nothing in between launches.

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 04/22/2020 05:20:37
Can you try to download the latest version of Webots R2020a revision 2 which was uploaded last night at [https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots/releases/tag/nightly\_21\_4\_2020](https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots/releases/tag/nightly_21_4_2020) and let me know if that resolves the problem? This version contains a patch that should fix it.

##### Greenhigh 04/22/2020 12:02:53
I have a question. Is there any way to set intrincs calibration for a camera? Like focal length and scew. It seems like if i add a focus node to the camera its possible to set a focal length but it seems to change noting.


I am trying to estimate a 3d point in the world from a pixel and depth mesurement. But i need the intrincs calibration inorder to do that üòÑ

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 04/22/2020 12:12:28
Hi `@Greenhigh`  To calibrate the camera, you can add a Lens node to the camera to calibrate the distortion ([https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/lens](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/lens)) and a Focus node ([https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/focus](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/focus)) to define the focal length (here is a demo with auto-focus: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHUt6ifcHfU](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHUt6ifcHfU))

##### Greenhigh 04/22/2020 13:08:01
I dont know if im doing it wrong but I tried to add the focal node and set a focal length. So now i can select a focal distance and focal length. but whenever i choose some values it changes focus as exspeted. but shouldnt the FOV change aswell?

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 04/22/2020 13:10:17
In Webots, the focal length and the FOV are not coupled you can change the FOV using the `fieldOfView` field of the camera.

##### Greenhigh 04/22/2020 13:21:51
So that is the diffrence between focal distance and focal length?


Shouldnt it just be one varible?


Focal length should that be kinda of a zoom. Like to detimine how much of the image will be captured in the field of view?

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 04/22/2020 13:27:07
The focal distance is the distance to the focusing plane.

And the focal length is the distance from the optical centre of the lens to the sensor. Bigger this value is, larger the sharp area is.

##### Psyka 04/22/2020 14:48:09
Hello there,



I have an issue for you guys, I've installed the last vesion of REV-2 and i'll try to launch some simulation by the console, with the option --log-performance=logfile but no logfile to be found after the end of the simulation. a friend of mine has a file in "C:\Program Files\Webots\" but I don't

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 04/22/2020 14:48:57
Let me try


For me it is working fine with revision 2. Try setting an absolute path so that you are sure you know where to look for the file.

##### Psyka 04/22/2020 14:53:58
hum I guess I have it wrong since I can't put an absolute path


it tell me: "webots: too many arguments" "try webots --help ..." and "could not open file: 'C:/Users/Name/Files/Webots/logfile'."


my cmd is :


webots --log-performance="C:\Program Files\Webots\logfile" project.wbt

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 04/22/2020 15:00:38
I am sorry, I don't have Windows yet to test, but on macOS and Linux it works fine even with absolute path for me, can you please open an issue here so that we can test on Windows: [https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots/issues/new?template=bug\_report.md](https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots/issues/new?template=bug_report.md)

Thank you

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 04/22/2020 15:01:01
I am investigating the issue on Windows right now.

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 04/22/2020 15:01:44
Perfect, thank you.

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 04/22/2020 15:20:41
`@Psyka`: can you try to type `webots-bin.exe` instead of `webots.exe`?

##### Psyka 04/22/2020 15:21:28
I think I make it work with an absolute path


after reinstalling


It working only when I put the logfile into an other hard drive like E: not on C: maybe a permission issue


It will be fine enough for what I need to do thank's very much


I have an other question around the log


Is it possible to set specified log from a simulation ?

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 04/22/2020 15:35:19
What do you mean exactly?

##### Psyka 04/22/2020 15:39:41
this log file is about performance


but can we get some with the position of elements at instant T and everything happening inside the simulation ?


I didn't find any ^^

##### yxc1280 04/22/2020 15:45:29
Hello, can you show me how to use sleep or delay function in Webots? Thank you!

##### dmknuth 04/22/2020 20:11:21
`@Olivier Michel`  the problem has not recurred with the new build (2020a-revision2)  Though I am hesitant to say this is resolved because I have seen it come back a day later before.  However, thank you for the new build.  If you don't hear from me again, then all is well!

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 04/23/2020 05:20:07
`@Psyka`: you should use supervisor to track down the positions of objects and store them in your own custom log file.


`@yxc1280`: a controller program should usually not `sleep()` as this will block the simulation process id the controller is synchronous. Instead you probably want to use the `wb_robot_step()` function and specify the duration as an argument (expressed in milliseconds). During this amount of time, the simulation will progress but your controller will do nothing.

##### Huey 04/23/2020 07:32:28
Morning everyone.. I was looking for epuck groundsensor documentation in python from the cyberbotics website


however, I cant seem to find it, would you guys mind giving me a pointer where this might be? Thankyou

##### Psyka 04/23/2020 07:36:34
`@Olivier Michel`  ok thank's I will check that

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 04/23/2020 07:41:14
`@Huey`, their name are indeed not documented ([https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/epuck#e-puck-characteristics](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/epuck#e-puck-characteristics)), but the names are `gs0`, `gs1` and `gs2`, and they work the exact same way than the other distance sensors.


Actually the names are documented just a bit after: [https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/epuck#devices-names](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/epuck#devices-names)

##### Huey 04/23/2020 07:48:29
Thanks `@David Mansolino` ! I would like add a new ground sensor function as epuck line follower behaviour using Python..


However, I  wonder if there is a documentation where i could refer in python, for example the library to include for ground sensors ,etc

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 04/23/2020 07:51:34
There is no notion of language, you have to add the sensor in the Webots scene-tree, then to use them you should do like with any other distance sensors, here is an example in Python: [https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/tutorial-6-4-wheels-robot?tab-language=python#the-controller-code](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/tutorial-6-4-wheels-robot?tab-language=python#the-controller-code)

##### Huey 04/23/2020 07:55:23
Cool.. Thanks `@David Mansolino`!

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 04/23/2020 14:38:05
`@David Mansolino` Quick question, how does a worldfile know, which .proto to load? I had to make a change to the ur10e.proto, and it made me save it in my project location instead of altering the original (totally fine). However, the .wbt file does not change. Where is the link to that file stored? I'm asking, because I'm working on a group project, and our git does not include the webots install

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 04/23/2020 14:42:37
Webots will load in priority the PROTO from the ``protos`` folder of your project and then (if it didn't find them) in the Webots installation directory.


To test this you can try to add the ur10e proto to your world using the add node dialog, you will see that the one in your project is available but the one in the Webots installation directory is grey and not addable.

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 04/23/2020 14:43:50
So as long as Include the protos in the protos folder here and the world file is in the world folder, it works?

Hello, I've been working with Webots for almost a year now and I feel very happy with the software and the community support. You guys rock!

As part of my Master Thesis at ULB I am working on the subject: "Machine Learning for Probabilistic Robotics with Webots" and I developed a Particle's Filter algorithm together with a visualisation plugin that I would like to share with you. A very small demo can be found on Youtube: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fISDutZca5g](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fISDutZca5g) and the code is here: [https://github.com/joangerard/webots-thesis](https://github.com/joangerard/webots-thesis) 

I am still working on the documentation part. Hopefully I will finish it by the end of next month. 

Is there anyone working on a similar subject?

`@kwy` not automatically, but you can use it as texture for the ground and place object manually on it, or write a script to do this, or use ground sensors to detect these black area from your robot controller


`@JoanGerard` very nice demo!!! Your robot-window looks very handy and your repository is very well organized (well documented and clean code), this is clearly a good reference for people wanting to use particle filter algorithm in Webots!


> Hi! I used the dBodyAddForce  in my physics plugin, but my simulation will crash. When I delete this line, and everything go back to normal. But I do need to add a force on my robot, what can I do? Help!

I have tried to place some path point (those red spots)on this map by supervisor.

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 04/24/2020 07:57:05
You're supervisor should probably read the map image and compute the location of the obstacle.

##### XZbot 04/24/2020 09:54:38
Hi `@David Mansolino` , I have two questions regarding the Webots environment. (1) I put an e-puck inside a triple T-maze constructed by walls. When it passes some T-intersection, I would like to temporarily block its way back so that it has to explore the unvisited area. I am not sure if a one-way door can be applied in this case, which means the e-puck can push the door from one direction but not the other, so that it won't go back after passing the door. Or can I make a door/wall suddenly appear at the intersection after the e-puck passes it during simulation? Or do you have some better suggestion?  (2) Can I run multiple simulation trials parallelly (at the same time) in the fast mode and how?  Thanks a lot!

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 04/24/2020 10:22:37
Hi `@XZbot`, yes you can make a wall appears using the Supervisor API (the simplest solution is to have the wall already present in the simulation and simply move it with the supervisor): [https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/supervisor](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/supervisor)

About multiple run, please find some explanation about numerical optimisation with Webots here: [https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/supervisor](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/supervisor)

##### SR-CNA 04/24/2020 14:48:34
I wonder if it is possible to let a plane to have a random color. For example, every time I start the simulation, I hope the color of the plane can be either red or blue. Is is possible?

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 04/24/2020 14:52:47
`@SR-CNA` yes, this is possible, for this you will have to create a PROTO of the plane and use procedural PROTO to define randomly the color.

I strongly advice to follow our tutorial about PROTO (and the previous one) if not already done: [https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/tutorial-7-your-first-proto](https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/tutorial-7-your-first-proto)

This is for creating a simple non-procedural PROTO, then you should read the documentation about procedural PROTO: [https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/tutorial-7-your-first-proto](https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/tutorial-7-your-first-proto)

And finally, you can find here an example of procedural PROTO: [https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots/blob/ad933d92210f17f784807cb33741ab4dc41d684f/projects/objects/factory/pallet/protos/WoodenPalletStack.proto#L22](https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots/blob/ad933d92210f17f784807cb33741ab4dc41d684f/projects/objects/factory/pallet/protos/WoodenPalletStack.proto#L22)

Is there an upper limit on the number of robots that can be included in the simulation? (I currently have 96 robots plus one supervisor that generates a TRAIL Shape for one of the robots that shows the path the robot has traversed.)

I am getting the following error (47 times):

`[void] socket connect() failed for /private/var/folders/tg/vymk3ysd1n14cpx7r7\_q5pgw0000gn/T/webots\_75232\_1507880620, errno=61

This may actually be due to an OS limit (MacOS) to the number of pipes, but the number seems small compared to what would normally be the limit.

`@nap` there is no limitation on the Webots side, but as you said, on the OS side there is a limitation about the number of pipe, but this configurable in your OS.


> We can see translation and rotational values on left side of the screen under a robots name. Can we get those values  in the code? and can we set those values from the code?

`@mearvind` to get them you can use a GPS device ([https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/gps9](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/gps9)).

To get AND change them you will need to use the Supervisor API: [https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/supervisor](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/supervisor)


> Does anyone know why this happens when moving the object along with a connector?

`@machinekoder` very nice demo!

Are you speaking of the warning you get in the console about the physics step?


> I am using gyro to turn my robot at certain degree but the problem is when I want it to stop at the particular amount of degree my robot won't stop

`@nikzzzlegrande` you set the position of the right motor to 0. But are you sure your motor is currently at position 0? And in any case as you exit right after sending the command without performing any robot step, the command is actually never sent to Webots.

P.S: next time use  screen shot instead of camera.

`@pro2017001` from the log it seems that your controller program crashed. You should debug it to find where is the bug that makes it crashing.

##### nap 04/27/2020 08:44:52
Is there a way to clear the console from code?  `printf("\f\n");` used to do that, but doesn't seem to do so anymore?

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 04/27/2020 08:46:02
On the nightly builds, you can use the ANSI control code to clear the console.

##### nap 04/27/2020 08:46:48
ok, thanks `@Olivier Michel` , how about 2020 rev 1a?

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 04/27/2020 08:48:16
In that version `printf("\f");` should work, isn't it?

##### nap 04/27/2020 08:49:27
I'm doing it from the physics plugin, where normally I've been using `dWebotsConsolePrintf`.  I can put it in my controller and see.

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 04/27/2020 08:52:37
I checked and it works for example in `projects/samples/devices/worlds/battery.wbt`

##### nap 04/27/2020 08:53:28
`@Olivier Michel` : yes, from my controller it works fine.  Not sure why it didn't work from the physics plugin, but I'm not going to worry about that for now.

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 04/27/2020 09:00:38
> `@David Mansolino` Hi i tried this but i had no luck. It doesnt output any feedback and ur is stuck

`@Rahul0496` on that case can you please add a comment and explain your issue in [https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots/issues/1362](https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots/issues/1362)

So that we can investigate and fix the issue. Thank you

##### pro2017001 04/27/2020 09:31:49
`@Stefania Pedrazzi` Ok, I will check.

##### nap 04/27/2020 09:38:35
`@David Mansolino` :  You won't believe it, but I'm still stuffing around with the motor/wheel noise.  I'm using `dRFromAxisAndAngle` to rotate a small amount left/right and then `dBodySetRotation` .  However, it looks to me that on each step, my previous rotation is 'undone' and the `dBodyGetRotation` is back to its original course.

I tried using Force and Torque (as well as Rel) as you originally suggested, but I have to apply such high values to overcome the coulombFriction that when the epuck finally alters it course, it flies away wildly.

Should I use Kinematics mode?  Any other suggestions?

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 04/27/2020 10:43:47
`@nap` why not simply changing the robot rotation using the Supervisor API instead of doing it from a physics plugin?

##### nap 04/27/2020 11:28:39
`@David Mansolino` : I could, but I figured using a physics plugin was the more natural way of doing it.  And to be honest, now that I've invested the time, I would like to work out why I'm having these problem.  Otherwise, I'll need to go through the learning curve again next time I attempt a physics plugin.

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 04/27/2020 11:45:01
Actually physics plugin are more and more outdated, the Supervisor API is getting so powerfull that it offers almost all the features fo the physics plugin (and is much more simple/stable).

##### Psyka 04/27/2020 11:59:22
Hello everyone :)

I've seen that there are some launching "mode" like "run" "pause" "fastrun" or "realtime", I've tried them but is there a silent mode where webot doesn't launch any visual just working like a hidden process


?


on windows I mean

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 04/27/2020 12:00:39
There is `--minimize` mode, that will open a iconified window.


Actually, your should probably combine `--minimize`, `--batch` and `--mode=fast`.

##### Psyka 04/27/2020 12:03:16
that's the more silent webots can do ?

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 04/27/2020 12:03:48
Yep.

##### Psyka 04/27/2020 12:04:30
I'm trying to do an anylizer of simulation and I will run like 20k short simulation, I would like not to see any of them


ok thank's ^^


I've got an other question for you ^^


Is there a way to get the simulation name from a controller ?


didn't find one from the supervisor

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 04/27/2020 12:06:38
Do you mean the world filename?

##### Psyka 04/27/2020 12:07:22
the "Title" from worldinfo


of the simulation

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 04/27/2020 12:07:43
You can get it from a supervisor controller.

##### Psyka 04/27/2020 12:07:57
haha


i'm stupid right ?


xD

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 04/27/2020 12:08:02
As you would get any other field of any node.

##### Psyka 04/27/2020 12:08:08
it's like a position

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 04/27/2020 12:08:12
Yes.

##### Psyka 04/27/2020 12:08:38
but I say "WorldInfo" and "title" for field ?

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 04/27/2020 12:08:49
Yes.

##### Psyka 04/27/2020 12:09:02
haha nice cool thx


have a nice day I think it's all for me today üôÇ


ho I've got a last question:


is it possible to creat in webot an invisible robot or object with a controller that can log everything ?

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 04/27/2020 12:23:28
Yes.

##### Psyka 04/27/2020 12:23:43
is it not better to do that then doing a log in every robot ?

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 04/27/2020 12:24:09
It depends on your need.

##### Psyka 04/27/2020 12:24:24
I've got a lot of robots to log


position


and one or two with a lot more parameter then position

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 04/27/2020 12:24:54
So, it's probably better in your case to have an invisible supervisor process logging everything.

##### Psyka 04/27/2020 12:25:14
ok thank's how can I do that the more efficient possible ?


having an invisible supervisor process do I have to creat it into the world file .wbt ?

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 04/27/2020 12:26:21
Yes.

##### Psyka 04/27/2020 12:33:31
is there a tuto or any doc who is showing an efficient way of creating an invisible supervisor process ?

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 04/27/2020 12:34:16
No. But it's very simple. Just create a Supervisor and if it has no children (default), then it is invisible.

##### Psyka 04/27/2020 12:35:51
something like :

Supervisor {

controller "my\_supervisor"

}


?

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 04/27/2020 12:36:04
Exactly.

##### Psyka 04/27/2020 12:36:12
ok thank's very much üòâ


Me again with an other question:

Is there a way to know when 2 robots touch each other ? or only by notifying the position of each and see when they are near each other ?


like a colision signal

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 04/27/2020 13:11:10
You may use a touch sensor on the robots.

##### Psyka 04/27/2020 13:12:32
ok thank's

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 04/27/2020 13:30:15
How can I tell webots to use the ros libraries installed on the system?


it gives me this:


ImportError: No module named tf

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 04/27/2020 13:38:10
Are you're ros library in the PYTHONPATH environment variable?

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 04/27/2020 13:39:22
yes


it only exists in python2 though


are you using a python3 compiled ros?


this would indicate python2

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 04/27/2020 13:42:10
No we are using python2 for ROS controllers

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 04/27/2020 13:42:51
In my .bashrc I have to include the source commands to add the paths


do I have to do that for webots too?


and if so, where?

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 04/27/2020 13:43:28
The ROS controller of the UR robots is using the version of the python ROS libraries distributed in Webots (which doesn't include TF), this is defined (and can be changed) here: [https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots/blob/master/projects/robots/universal\_robots/controllers/universal\_robots\_ros/runtime.ini](https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots/blob/master/projects/robots/universal_robots/controllers/universal_robots_ros/runtime.ini)

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 04/27/2020 13:44:56
can I edit this on a per project basis, or do I have to alter the install?


I am using a edited version of the universal\_robot\_ros controler, which is in its own git repository, not in the webots install

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 04/27/2020 13:48:27
Yes you can edit it per project, you just have to edit the runtime.ini file associated with your controller.

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 04/27/2020 13:49:23
shouldn't this line in the runtime.ini

PYTHONPATH=$(WEBOTS\_HOME)/projects/lang....

be this:

PYTHONPATH=$(PYTHONPATH):$(WEBOTS\_HOME)/projects/lang....


this would automatically add the stuff installed on the system


good news, altering the runtime.ini works, bad news, tons of other errors. will investigate and post results

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 04/27/2020 14:04:15
> shouldn't this line in the runtime.ini

> PYTHONPATH=$(WEBOTS\_HOME)/projects/lang....

> be this:

> PYTHONPATH=$(PYTHONPATH):$(WEBOTS\_HOME)/projects/lang....

`@Simon Steinmann` yes if you want to preserve the ``PYTHONPATH`` (in our case as we don't want that a possible ROS installation on the computer cause conflicts we don't want to preserve it).

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 04/27/2020 14:05:12
the ROS\_PACKAGE\_PATH= also has to be appended, for it to work


now the controller is crashing... hmm perhaps I should do extra ros stuff outside of webots.... On a different note, is it possible to get positions (using supervisor) relative to a specific frame? I want to get the gripper position relative to the robot base, not the world


right now my approach is to us the tf library to use kinematics tree transformation to calculate the toolslot position using the published tf topic. seems like uneccesary extra work. Is it possible to get that data directly?

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 04/27/2020 14:16:49
> now the controller is crashing... hmm perhaps I should do extra ros stuff outside of webots.... On a different note, is it possible to get positions (using supervisor) relative to a specific frame? I want to get the gripper position relative to the robot base, not the world

`@Simon Steinmann` looks like a good approach. For the supervisor, you can get the absolute position of both nodes and the compute te difference

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 04/27/2020 14:17:41
that's true. any library you'd recommend? eigen?

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 04/27/2020 14:18:34
No, I am sorry I don't know, but for sure you will find some suggestions on Google ;-)

Hi, can you help me with recording a movie with the Supervisor? I have multiple problems, my idea was to see if the motion is over and stop the video recording. However the Motion.isOver returned true in the middle of the motion. I tried to comment out the video creating lines but I keep getting the error that the "Nothing was recorded because the simulation didn¬¥t run" even though there is no line to make a recording. I get the warning at every timestep.



EDIT: I tried restarting WeBots, but now it just starts up and crashes instantly without a warning.

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 04/28/2020 06:32:53
If you don't create the movie, but issue a print statement when the motion is over, does it work as expected?

##### Dorteel 04/28/2020 06:34:00
No, it just prints the line a couple timesteps in the motion.


Is there a way to start up WeBots without autostarting the simulation? That seems to be why it¬¥s crashing

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 04/28/2020 06:35:38
Yes, you can select the startup mode from the Webots Preferences (pause mode).


Or use the `--mode=pause` command line argument.

##### Dorteel 04/28/2020 06:37:03
Ah, I opened another world and now I have it running. I'll set the preferences, thank you

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 04/28/2020 06:37:49
It could be that one of your other controllers is crashing or hanging...

##### Dorteel 04/28/2020 06:38:14

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 04/28/2020 06:38:19

not just with my custom motion, same issue when I try it with the built-in motion files

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 04/28/2020 06:52:09
`isOver` is a method, did you try to add parenthesis?, i.e., `self.testingMotion.isOver()`?

Hello, i have a problem getting webots running python. I have installed python 3.8 (anaconda) and started webots "Python 3.7 not found" -> installed Python 3.7 -> "No module named 'numpy'" ..

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 04/28/2020 08:13:01
Is the 'numpy' module installed?

``python3.7 pip-m install numpy``

##### adaptive 04/28/2020 08:14:00
Numpy and any other lib is installed for 3.8

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 04/28/2020 08:15:22
But since you installed python 3.7 it seems it is using python 3.7 and therefore numpy is not installed for 3.7.

About python 3.8, which version of Webots are you using and on which OS ?

##### adaptive 04/28/2020 08:15:43
im using R2020a on Win10


rev1

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 04/28/2020 08:17:18
Ok that explains the problem, the support of Python 3.8 in Webots on Windows is not supported in R2020a-rev1, it will be in the next version of Webots. You can get a beta of the next version (R2020a-rev2) including Python 3.8 support on Windows by downloading a nightly build here: [https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots/releases](https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots/releases)

##### adaptive 04/28/2020 08:18:12
ok, i will install the nightly build instead of installing two python distributions parallel, that seems smarter. Thanks

You're welcome

##### adaptive 04/28/2020 08:42:43
`@David Mansolino` hm.. i installed Rev2 but the error still appears.. running python in cmd shows 3.8.2 running. [https://bpaste.net/YWLA](https://bpaste.net/YWLA) this is the output of webots running an example world

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 04/28/2020 08:45:01
Can you print the Python version from your controller program to check it is the same?

```
import sys
print("Python version")
print (sys.version)
```

##### adaptive 04/28/2020 08:48:06
I created a new project and inserted the code into an new controller, but how do I execute it?

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 04/28/2020 08:48:26
Simply create a robot that uses this controller.


It may be simpler to start from the `WEBOTS_HOME/projects/languages/python/worlds/example.wbt` sample world and edit the `slave.py` controller for example.


Also check that the Python command is set to "python" in the Webots preferences.

I have a robot model(Clearpath Robotics Warthog) and three Universal Robot Arms(2 UR3 and 1 UR5) all at front. each UR3 weighs 11.2 kg and UR5 20.6 kg. UR3's are on the side and UR5 is in the the middle of both UR3's. The robot can travel at a speed of 18 km\hr. 



I want to check the stability of the platform at lower as well as higher speeds in two configurations. One as shown in the figure(UR 5 a little behind 2 UR3's) and another one when the all are inline at the front.



The desired one is the second configuration where all arms are at the front and inline to give maximum area for manipulation.

3.8.2 seems better if you have Webots R2020a revision 2, but 3.7 should work also.

##### Tahir [Moderator] 04/28/2020 10:09:26
OK I will do that


do you have any leads for the solution to this problem

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 04/28/2020 10:11:09
Not really. You should create an accurate model of the robot in Webots and running on various terrains.

##### Tahir [Moderator] 04/28/2020 10:11:41
Also is Blender 2.79b is the minimum or exact requirement for Webots importer to work


?

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 04/28/2020 10:12:10
Exact. 2.80 doesn't work.

is this fine

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 04/28/2020 10:15:17
No, you really need 2.79b.

`@nikzzzlegrande` you simply need to add a supervisor and track the position at each step, from these positions you can compute the distance traveled at each step (and sum it to get the total distance).

Does anybody know whether the position sensor in webots has positive or negative?

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 04/28/2020 12:24:29
The position sensors returns the current position of the joint, so it can be negative or positive depending on which direction goes the joint

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 04/28/2020 12:50:48
Does your blender model have a hierarchy or are all the meshes at the root level?

##### Tahir [Moderator] 04/28/2020 12:54:34
It is one single object

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 04/28/2020 12:56:07
Then if it is one single object, it will be exported as a single object and not as an articulated robot, it needs to be cut in various different parts in Blender to have something with a hierarchy of nodes in Webots.

##### Tahir [Moderator] 04/28/2020 12:56:30
OK I got your point


Let me check something

##### lshil 04/28/2020 12:58:49
Is the angle of the position sensor defined as the angle between current position and initial position?

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 04/28/2020 13:12:10
> Is the angle of the position sensor defined as the angle between current position and initial position?

`@lshil` it is not exactly the initial position, because some joint may start from a non zero initial position, but it is defined as the angle between current position and zero angle.

Hello,

I've got an issue with the controller that I'am using, first it was working well when I had only one then I created an other one for a different caind of robots and now the first one doesn't compile anymore it says :  undefined reference to `wbu\_driver\_set\_cruising\_speed'


but I have #include <webots/vehicle/driver.h>


I'm on windows

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 04/28/2020 13:15:18
``wbu\_driver\_set\_cruising\_speed``  is working only for node based on the ``Car`` PROTO, with which robots are you using it?

##### Psyka 04/28/2020 13:15:26
a car


it was working well

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 04/28/2020 13:16:16
Does your makefile have the following libraries links:

```

?

##### Psyka 04/28/2020 13:16:25

Is there a way to dynamically set the "python command" in the preferences ? (using a cli argument for instance)


My use case is : I have a python virtualenv for webots' controllers, this venv path is going to be different on each developper machine


I would like to avoid the process of setting it manually

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 04/28/2020 13:55:23
You may change the Webots preference file before starting Webots using a script.

Or you might define it in a runtime.ini file next to the controller (which can be written dynamically): [https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/controller-programming#languages-settings](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/controller-programming#languages-settings)


Would this suit your needs?

##### Axel M [Premier Service] 04/28/2020 13:57:12
I guess the second option would be the best to plug into a CMake workflow, executing the command to get the venv path (like `pipenv --venv`), and piping the output in a runtime.ini


Gonna give it a try. Thanks !

##### Lars 04/29/2020 07:58:26
I'm observing some strange behavior of my fruits in WeBots. Physics and BO is defined for all of them, but some move right through the surface they are put on as shown in the video. I've tried different physics settings such as removing mass and changing it for density, added intertia matrix, dampening, etc.

Does it all come down to the bounding object and being too complex? Especially the grapes is a bad one I think.
> **Attachment**: [fruit\_test.mp4](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/565154703139405824/704964802958721024/fruit_test.mp4)


For reference the left-most banana, green apple and orange are standard fruits from WeBots itself and they work just fine like some of the other fruits I implemented.

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 04/29/2020 08:48:30
Yes, I suspect that bounding object made up of small but complex meshes are responsible for such a behavior. I would recommend you to avoid IndexedFaceSet for the bounding objects and use instead a combination of simple primitives (such as spheres, capsules and boxes).

##### Alex123 04/29/2020 08:59:53
hello,I want to know that is there any ready sample for collecting data of sick's sensors in webots

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 04/29/2020 09:02:19
`@Alex123`, not as I know, but there are sample for getting the value from the sick sensors, then if you want to save them to a file you can simply do this as you would do in any regular program (Webots controllers are regular program).

##### Lars 04/29/2020 09:10:07
`@Olivier Michel` Thanks, that's what I was anticipating, but I was hoping it would be something different. The complexity was somewhat needed to emulate real world use case of grasping these types of fruits.

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 04/29/2020 09:12:10
Yes, but with a complex combination of spheres of different sizes and capsules of different lengths and diameters, I am sure you can achieve a pretty precise bounding object for most fruits.

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 04/29/2020 09:14:25
`@Lars` have you tried drastically reducing the world time step?

##### Lars 04/29/2020 09:33:10
`@David Mansolino` With `basicTimeStep = 4` the test world runs at about half real-time speed and most of the fruits are doing alright aside from one of the lemons. Reducing the time step to 1 everything works fine, but it only runs at 1/10th of real time.

But in the world with the robot system I think this would be problematic as we have issues with ROS synchronization,  the clock resets all the time and giving us warnings (e.g. `Moved back in time (probably because ROS clock was reset)`)

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 04/29/2020 10:15:43

##### Tahir [Moderator] 04/29/2020 11:01:15
I have one robot base with a frame. I want to mount three UR arms on it. 

what is better hierarchy for Webots. All arm nodes inside the robot base node or 4 separate robot nodes (3 arms and 1 base) and than mounted on base

##### Lars 04/29/2020 11:17:51
> Did you set the use\_sim\_time parameter to true?

`@David Mansolino` Yeah it's set to true in the launch file

##### Alejandro Pescathore 04/29/2020 11:19:21
I am trying to build a tracked robot in Webots, but the robot cannot rotate, it just goes forward and backward. How can i solve this problem?

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 04/29/2020 11:21:49
It all depends on how you plan to control it.

If you want one central control then one single robot is better. But if you want to have one control algorithm for the base and one for each arm then it is better to have one Robot for the base and one sub-robot for each arm (this is my favourite solution, but again it all depends on what you want to do). Not also that if you use the ROS interface for example, one robot per arm is better.


> `@David Mansolino` Yeah it's set to true in the launch file

`@Lars` ok, then you probably have to go for simpler bounding object, because the ros interface doesn't like indeed when the simulation runs was slower than real time


> I am trying to build a tracked robot in Webots, but the robot cannot rotate, it just goes forward and backward. How can i solve this problem?

`@Alejandro Pescathore` I would recommend to have a look at this simple example that can indeed rotate: [https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/samples-devices#track-wbt](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/samples-devices#track-wbt)

So, I'm working on a scene with a proto inside a proto. I want to modify the value of a custom field (of type MF Bool)


I can retrieve the correct "pointer" on that field, but when I try to modify its values, it doesn't seems to work

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 04/29/2020 14:05:25
From the Supervisor you want to change this field, right?

##### Gautier A. 04/29/2020 14:06:02
Yes, from a supervisor

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 04/29/2020 14:06:22
When you said ''a proto inside a proto", is the children PROTO in a field of the parent PROTO or is it internal to the parent PROTO ?

##### Gautier A. 04/29/2020 14:07:09

The "interesting proto" is in a children node of another proto, it's not internal

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 04/29/2020 14:08:22

Yes, we're using a beta version of Webots R2020b. We compile it from source because we needed the function "getFromProtoDef"

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 04/29/2020 14:09:48

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 04/29/2020 14:15:38
Have you tried replacing ``getFromProtoDef`` by ``getFromDef``? The field you are trying to get is indeed in a PROTO but it is visible in the scene-tree (and is therefore not internal).

##### Gautier A. 04/29/2020 14:17:42
Yes, I get the same exact result and same exact output


(I actually tried in first instance 'getFromDef' before 'getFromProtoDef' )

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 04/29/2020 14:20:48
OK, in that case that looks indeed like a bug. Can you check what you get if you try to get the value of this field from the supervisor (i.e. ``std::cout<<"Hello "<< isLockedTileContainer->getMFBool(i); <<", " << i <<std::endl;``) ?

##### Gautier A. 04/29/2020 14:23:51

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 04/30/2020 09:34:08
Yes. But what do mean by "world height"? Each rectangle arena will have it own height.

##### Greenhigh 04/30/2020 09:37:28
for example if you have two rectangle areana's at diffrent height. It seems like any object can not go below the top most areana. They just float in the air. Sort of difining the world hight since the objects cant go below the top areana?

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 04/30/2020 09:39:20
I see, this is because of the plane primitive which is used as the bounding object of the floor proto. In that case, if you need different levels, you should probably create your own rectangle arena proto which uses a Box instead of the Plane for the floor.

Yes this is possible, it is not very easy, you have to change the default orientation of the Solid node in the `endPoint`  field of the joint.

Hi, I'm trying to use the simulationReset() method of the Supervisor, but it makes the  my world go crazy.  I'm supposed to record a sequence of motions as videos, then resetting the simulation at the end of the motion, changing some variables (the colour of the robot), and then recording again, multiple times. When resetting, the variables do not reset, and the inner loops that change the variables go nuts and out of sequence, and the robot does not get reset to the right location either. Any suggestions?

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 04/30/2020 14:49:00
Have you tried with the ``worldReload`` function instead of the ``simulationReset``one ?

##### Dorteel 04/30/2020 14:50:34
I was thinking about it, but doesn¬¥t it reset the controller?

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 04/30/2020 14:53:30
Yes it does, but just to check if it fixes the issue with your not resetting correctly

##### Dorteel 04/30/2020 14:54:30
Ah, alright, I'll try


Yes, the simulation resets correctly, although it resets twice for some reason

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 04/30/2020 15:04:33
Ok thanks for the confirmation.

And with ``simulationReset`` what is not rest correctly with your robot?

##### Dorteel 04/30/2020 15:07:08
the main issue was that the position of the robot did not reset, but stayed right where it was when the method was called, it was only the joint angles that reset.


The print functions didn¬¥t work either, and the loop of the controller was messed up, it changed the colours, but did not record the videos. But that could be because the robot was embedded in the middle of a table


but the worldReload helps, I can create files that save the state of the loop and read them when the controller resets. So thanks for the help!

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 04/30/2020 15:11:38

Hello! the Opencv library has functions that allow you to perform camera calibration: [https://docs.opencv.org/2.4/modules/calib3d/doc/camera\_calibration\_and\_3d\_reconstruction.html](https://docs.opencv.org/2.4/modules/calib3d/doc/camera_calibration_and_3d_reconstruction.html). Please tell me, is it possible to do the same operation for a camera that is a sensor in Webots?

##### nap 05/01/2020 00:26:43
In the `supervisor.h` API, there are a number of functions that include `sf` in their names; e.g. `wb_supervisor_field_get_sf_rotation` .  What is the meaning of `sf`?

##### Estelle 05/01/2020 00:27:23
it means single field

##### nap 05/01/2020 00:55:28
`@Estelle` :  Thanks.  Would you know where I can get a definition of `field`?  (Sorry, I wasn't asking you to write an essay about it.)

##### Estelle 05/01/2020 00:59:29
Sorry, I just don't quite understand what you mean. Do you mean the definition of field for specific nodes?

##### nap 05/01/2020 01:00:40
`@Estelle` :  I'm not familiar with the term `field` (as it is being used here), so I was asking for a reference which I can read.


`@Estelle` :  I found a reference to it in the Webots Glossary ([https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/glossary](https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/glossary)).  I'll look into the VRML97 specification.

##### Estelle 05/01/2020 01:06:04
OK~Because I am a beginner to use webots, so there are somethings I do not know very well. I'm happy that you find it~üôÇ

`@iagsav` yes you can, however not that there are some differences between real and openGL camera ([https://www.scratchapixel.com/lessons/3d-basic-rendering/perspective-and-orthographic-projection-matrix/opengl-perspective-projection-matrix](https://www.scratchapixel.com/lessons/3d-basic-rendering/perspective-and-orthographic-projection-matrix/opengl-perspective-projection-matrix)),

##### Tahir [Moderator] 05/01/2020 13:30:51
I am having an issue when I run the simulation the floor starts to vibrate


the robot weighs around 400 kilos

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 05/01/2020 13:33:59
The floor is supposed to be a static object so it should never move. Since the robot is quite heavy, have you tried changing the contact properties ([https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/contactproperties](https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/contactproperties)) ?

Basically setting the `softCFM` to a lower value (e.g. 1e-05), the `coulombFriction` to a higher value (e.g. 5 to 10) and the WorldInfo.ERP to a higher value (e.g. 0.6).

Decreasing the time step may also help (e.g. to 10ms).

##### Tahir [Moderator] 05/01/2020 13:36:28
I already have set these values:



ERP=0.6

basicTimeStep=8

coulumbFriction=8

softCFM=1e-05

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 05/01/2020 13:37:03
Ok, these values looks good indeed.

##### Tahir [Moderator] 05/01/2020 13:37:31

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 05/01/2020 13:39:10
> also when I start moving the robot the UR3 arm joint breaks and look like this

`@Tahir` that's probably another issue. Did you set the `staticBase` field of the UR3 to False?


> I already have set these values:

> 

> ERP=0.6

> basicTimeStep=8

> coulumbFriction=8

> softCFM=1e-05

`@Tahir` about this, have you tried with the void controller, just to make sure if it is the robot model or the controller that makes it vibrating?

##### Tahir [Moderator] 05/01/2020 14:00:13
The floor vibration is  same with void as well

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 05/01/2020 14:01:08
Did you check the `staticbase` value?

##### Tahir [Moderator] 05/01/2020 14:02:13
Yes in robotic arms


but there is nothing in the base robot node

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 05/01/2020 14:03:11
In the `UR3` PROTO node, there is a `staticBase` which is TRUE by default, in you case you have to set it to FALSE ([https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/ure#field-summary](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/ure#field-summary)).

##### Tahir [Moderator] 05/01/2020 14:03:26
Yes I did


and its still the same

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 05/01/2020 14:04:03
The arm joint still breaks ?

##### Tahir [Moderator] 05/01/2020 14:04:15
I have three UR arms and all of them are set to false


no arms does not break


sorry I am talking about floor vibration

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 05/01/2020 14:06:27
Ok, in that case I am sorry but I can't help you further without trying your simulation.

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 05/02/2020 05:28:40
Hi `@dralorg`, the simplest solution is to temporarily convert the Youbot node in Base nodes (you can do this by right-clicking on the Youbot node in the scene-tree), this way you will be able to select the wheels in the scene-tree and read their position in 'position' tab of the nod editor: [https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/the-scene-tree#field-editor](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/the-scene-tree#field-editor)

`@David Mansolino` : I've implemented a Supervisor that rotates the epuck every 10 time\_steps.  In the attached screenshot, I have the trail marked (using the the webots trail example supervisor but with more data points) and my 'noise' code (basically all of it is visible in the image).  The noise at the moment increments the CW rotation of the epuck on each step, while the epuck thinks it's going straight.  However, the result is confusing me.

1)  I had to apply rotation around the Y axis but using the Z axis orientation.  I would have thought I should be able to progressively change the Y rotation, but when I do that, there is no rotation.  Is there a  coordinate system swap going on somewhere?

2) Since I'm increasing the angle linearly, don't understand why the path is the way it is.  I would have expected to simply read the orientation and add a small amount of noise to it.  However, I need to multiply the noise by the number of iteration otherwise the epuck travels in a straight line after the initial deviation.

3) Is the rotation function using ARCTAN?  I don't think so, because the epuck does achieve more than 360 degrees of rotation.  However the path, in my mind should have been a circle rather than a weird spiral.

There is already a demo project on this but now when i trying to build from scratch i m not getting how to add ground sensor in the robot

And if i change the size of the rectangular area and floor tile the existing project seems to fail i don't know whats the issue


Can anyone help me with that

`@David Mansolino` :  There is something strange going on here.  In the attached image, I'm adding a relative torque to the epuck's body every 10 steps.  If I add 0.05 (lower portion of the image), the robot starts turning left for a few steps (may be just one) but then continues straight.  However, if I add 0.06 (top part), the robot performs the path I mentioned in my post above, square with arced sides.

`@pheonixash` : The epuck has a attachment point called `groundSensorSlot` in its interface (expand the epuck node in the LHS panel.  You need to add `E-puckGroundSensors` to this node.

When you change the floor size, your texture is scaled up/down accordingly. You should set the dimensions of your arena and then create the texture with the appropriate line widths.  (floorSize and floorTileSize work together.)

You should not change the size of the E-puck.  It will simply look smaller if you make your world larger.


`@lshil` there could be a number of things going wrong here.  You have to explain more clearly what you are trying to do.

##### pheonixash 05/04/2020 03:20:04
`@nap`  yup there is an attachment for groundsensor in epuck but I want to add ground sensor in some other robot which I created so how can I do that

##### nap 05/04/2020 03:21:42
`@pheonixash` : edit the proto of your robot and add the same node that the e-puck proto has.  Then, into that node, add the E-puckGroundSensor.

##### pheonixash 05/04/2020 03:22:15
`@nap` sorry I m not getting how to do

##### nap 05/04/2020 03:22:30
when  you edit your robot's proto, note that there is a node in the structure under "children" but there is also a reference in the interface section (fields)


study the proto for the e-puck and experiment.   You will get it. (I don't have to the time to make an example for you.)

##### pheonixash 05/04/2020 03:23:37
Sure I will try and let you know

> when I use the wb\_position\_sensor\_get\_value() function and try to "printf" angle, it always shows 1.#QNAN0

`@lshil` did you call the wb\_robot\_step function between enabling the sensor and getting the value?


> We are facing a problem regarding the assembly of the model as it is not staying in the given positions. We are trying to build a snake bot and the body parts keep coming to the origin of the robot where its head is. We have tried multiple things with no avail. Any solutions to this issue?

`@nap` it is indeed strange that you have to multiply by index, can you try printing the value of the rotation you get (I do suspect that you get the value of one step before and therefore before the increment).


About the orientation, it seems from your code that you are correctly rotating around the Y axis and not Z, I am not sure what you mean Z axis orientation (in Webots the up axis is Y).

##### nap 05/04/2020 05:55:44
> About the orientation, it seems from your code that you are correctly rotating around the Y axis and not Z, I am not sure what you mean Z axis orientation (in Webots the up axis is Y).

`@David Mansolino` you will notice I'm using the indice "2" not "1".

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 05/04/2020 05:58:52
Oh ok I see, this is because you are using `wb_supervisor_node_get_orientation`  which returns a rotation matrix ([https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/supervisor#wb\_supervisor\_node\_get\_orientation](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/supervisor#wb_supervisor_node_get_orientation)), you should probably use the rotation field instead:

`wb_supervisor_field_get_sf_rotation(rotField);`

This is probably the reason why you have to multiply by `index` too.

##### nap 05/04/2020 06:03:05
Ok, I'll try that.


`@David Mansolino` :  Ok, I've used `wb_supervisor_field_get_sf_rotation`, added a delta to the angle, fourth indice ([3]), and then used `wb_supervisor_field_set_sf_rotation`.  The results were promising at the start but then the circle turned into a spiral.

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 05/04/2020 10:32:22
Hi `@LaCava`, the position is reset at the position it was when loading the world. However, you can from your supervisor move your robot where you want at the first step after resetting the simulation.

##### LaCava 05/04/2020 10:33:20
Is there a way to specify the position when loading the world, or is that fixed? Otherwise, I'll just move it, thanks!


(By position, I mean joint angles, not XYZ space)


Sorry for the ambiguity there

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 05/04/2020 10:35:16
No problem. To move the joints position is a bit more tricky. First, is your robot a PROTO node or noe?

##### LaCava 05/04/2020 10:35:47
It's a NAO v5, straight from the PROTO

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 05/04/2020 10:37:38
Ok, in that case the simplest solution is probably to un-prototize the robot (right click on the robot->`Convert to Base Node(s)`), this way you will be able to access the `position` field of the robot from your supervisor and change them at the first step after the reset.

`@Aan` the sample controller of the mavic2pro example is extremely simple, there is no position feedback from the gps or any other sensors used to stabilize it.

I am trying to make a robot grasp a banana on a flat surface. I am using the UR5 robot and the Tiago parallel gripper. However, when "clamping" the banana and moving the gripper up, the banana slips out of the grasp. What could cause this?



I have tried running with smaller timestep, with no luck. I also tried playing around with contact material and contact properties, also no luck. I also tried with a higher coloumb friction on the gripper, same as the others, no luck

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 05/04/2020 13:31:50
Hi `@Janx1913` time step and coloumb friction are indeed the firest things to try. Can you share a small video of the problem?

##### Janx1913 05/04/2020 13:45:41
Here you go. Here the timestep is 8 and coloumb friction -1

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 05/04/2020 13:49:33
Thank you, everything looks good indeed, what you should try to do is:

  1. try with an extremely small tiem step to check if it helps (e.g. 1).

  2. try to understand what is happenning by enableing the boundign objects and contact points optionnal rendering.

  3. perform a control of the gripper in torque instead of position.

Your proto is named "robot"?

##### Tahir [Moderator] 05/06/2020 16:26:08
no its a dummy just for the sake of info


proto name is consistent as the file name and in the deifnition


this happens to all other protos to my working directory as well


may be this is because I dont have a project just only .wbt file and protos folder


because in the main window with the world file name it is written 'No Project'

Hi, I'm trying to get the rotation of the robot frame respect to the world frame. I achieved that by doing:

    supervisor = Supervisor()

    robot\_node = supervisor.getFromDef("youbot")

    orientation = robot\_node.getOrientation()



But then my old code where I retrieved the encoders:

    robot = Robot()

    robot.getPositionSensor('wheel1sensor')



Is complaining that "Only one instance of the Robot class should be created"



Then if I try to get the same encoders but with the robot\_node:

    supervisor = Supervisor()

    robot\_node = supervisor.getFromDef("youbot")

    robot\_node.getPositionSensor('wheel1sensor')



It complains like: "AttributeError: 'Node' object has no attribute 'getPositionSensor'"



Is it possible to get the encoders from the supervisor mode?

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 05/06/2020 17:33:42
you should simply call `supervisor.getPositionSensor('wheel1Sensor')`.


Don't forget that the `Supervisor` class inherits from the `Robot` class, so all its methods can be used the same way.

You can get the camera raw image from your python controller and send it to whatever you want, or save the image to a file and then use this file from html.

Here is an example in Python where the camera image is sent to a custom html robot window that you can use as a base to write your own export: [https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots/blob/master/projects/samples/robotbenchmark/visual\_tracking/controllers/visual\_tracking/visual\_tracking.py#L34](https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots/blob/master/projects/samples/robotbenchmark/visual_tracking/controllers/visual_tracking/visual_tracking.py#L34)

I checked your simulation, the biggest issue I see is that the weight of the 'BEAM\_BASE' solid is extremely big. I assume this is to simulate the fact that it is part of the ground and can't move ?

Instead of using a very heavy mass, it is better to set the endpoint of the joint to be a 'SolidReference' node and to set the name to ``<static environment>`, this way the end of the joint will be locked to the environment: [https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/solidreference](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/solidreference)


Here is a very draft version of this.

Ah yes I have used that before I tried the simple version, but then I couldnt find the functions in the controller anywhere, so I was wondering where those functions are made.


It does launch then but the controls dont work, and I was looking for an example to stop the motors or slow them down, but I couldnt find them anywhere in the thymio2 controller code that was provided, so I couldnt really implement it into our robot yet

`@lshil` it means that your controller is either not responsive anymore or does not check for the returned value of the step function (if the returned value is equal to `-1.0` your controller should exit).


> I am using a light sensor to detect a light source .... so is it possible to get separate RGB values of the detected light as output using this light sensor?

`@yash` not directly, however you can put color filters on light sensors, yo sou can put 3 light sensors, each with one different color filter to detect the RGB values: [https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/lightsensor#field-summary](https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/lightsensor#field-summary)

You are trying the Webots C API in a C++ controller.

For C++ you should instead use the Robot::wwiReceive function: [https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/robot?tab-language=c++#wb\_robot\_wwi\_receive](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/robot?tab-language=c++#wb_robot_wwi_receive)

But no matter the difference, it always drives forward. It's like there's so much sideways friction that it will only go forwards and backwards?


I can see the wheels spinning at the right speeds.

Do you know any leads for what I could check/read to solve this issue please?

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 05/08/2020 15:01:01
Did you check that the wheels are independent?

##### Doc 05/08/2020 15:01:33
They are on two separate rotational motors and I can definitely control then independently

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 05/08/2020 15:01:43
Is the big back wheel a motorized wheel or is it passive?

##### Doc 05/08/2020 15:02:04
it's motorised but the speed is set to 0 (which is probably part of the problem)

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 05/08/2020 15:02:32
I see... I would replace it with a sphere and set a very low friction on it.

##### Doc 05/08/2020 15:02:47
Right I'll give that a go, thanks

Hello everyone, I am new on this discord.



I'm using webots on a master project and have some questions :

- I am trying to overshoot my webots PIDs without realistic success. Is it better to implement a custom PID in the controller directly or could I missed something in the simulation that makes my webots PIDs unrealistic ?

- Are the simulation with webots deterministics or there is always some noise automatically added to make them more realistic but not deterministic ?



Thank you in advance for your help. I can provide parameters if it is needed to better understand my questions.

##### Professor Felix 05/08/2020 15:49:49
hello, I just had one small question. Theoretically, what is the best way to get a live video feed into a working program memory (for example, storing the pixels as a Tensor)? I'm assuming i'd just use the wb\_camera\_get\_image for every frame and then store every frame together, but I was wondering if anyone had some better suggestions

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 05/08/2020 15:54:41
`@lojik`: the PID control is performed here: [https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots/blob/master/src/webots/nodes/WbMotor.cpp#L248-L260](https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots/blob/master/src/webots/nodes/WbMotor.cpp#L248-L260). I would recommend you to recompile Webots from the source and add some printf statements here, so that you can better understand what's wrong with your approach.


About determinism. Yes: Webots is deterministic. The same noise seed is applied when you run twice the same simulation, so that you should obtain the very same results. If you want it to be non deterministic, you can simply have your controller wait for some random amount of time (using a time-based seed) before starting to move the robot and you will get non-reproducible results.


`@Professor Felix`: your approach seems good.

##### Professor Felix 05/08/2020 15:58:08
thank you

##### lojik 05/08/2020 16:03:56
`@Olivier Michel` Thank you for both of your answers.

- I will take a look on the PID part to try finding why it is not working.

- So if I do not have the same result on each experiment I should have a look on my controller instead of webots ? There is no parameters inside webots that makes it non deterministic ?

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 05/08/2020 16:05:01
That's correct.

##### lojik 05/08/2020 16:06:11

Hi, I want to install the latest nightly build. Do I have to compile it myself or do I use this? [https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots/releases](https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots/releases) Are these the newest compiles?


and what is the difference between 2020a and b?

##### lojik 05/09/2020 15:45:19
`@Alejandro Pescathore` as I understand, on webots coulomb friction work as follow:

1. while there is no force bigger than <coulomb friction>*<normal force at this point> the two object will not slip pass each other

2. as soon as you have a force bigger than the one set with coulomb friction (in point 1.), you will have a speed equal to the <force acting on your object>*<forceDependentSlip cofficient set>



Coulomb friction coefficients bigger than one are physically correct.



But even with these informations I can not set a frottement that is physically satisfaying on my side too... Do someone has good tricks to have good results with a four wheeled robot turning on spot using differential wheels ? As soon as I test it on inclined plan it will just slip down the slope.


Finally I obtained something not too bad with 0.8 as a friction coulomb and 0.001 as a forceDependentSlip (if it is smaller it produce non symmetric results)


But I am not totally convinced with this solution ..

##### Stefania Pedrazzi [cyberbotics] 05/11/2020 06:25:03
`@Alejandro Pescathore` here you can find the detailed description of the friction approximation made by the physical engine ODE used by Webots: [http://ode.org/wiki/index.php?title=Manual#Friction\_Approximation](http://ode.org/wiki/index.php?title=Manual#Friction_Approximation). Unfortunately I don't have any calibrated values for contact properties between rubber and wood.


`@Aan` at the moment Webots doesn't have any microphone device to detect sound sources in a simulation. But it's already in our plan to add it.

However you could cheat and get the Speaker node (or any placeholder node for the sound source) position using the Supervisor API (for example [https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/supervisor?tab-language=c++#wb\_supervisor\_node\_get\_position](https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/supervisor?tab-language=c++#wb_supervisor_node_get_position))


`@Simon Steinmann` usually the nightly build are available as compiled packages that you just have to download and install. Just click on the Assets drop down menu and pick your package: [https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots/releases](https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots/releases)

It can happen that some errors occur during the nightly build and thus some packages are missing for a particular day but usually all the packages are available.

The difference between the current two versions is that R2020a revision 2 contains is fixed version completely compatible with R2020a, and R2020b contains new features and changes that could break the compatibility with the previous version of Webots.


`@Weiyi` there are different methods that you could use to model a barrier, here are a youple of suggestions:

1. passive: Add a big bounding object to the barrier and a DistanceSensor to the car that will detect it: when the barrier will be lifted the distance sensor value changes and the car can continue

2. active: add Emitter/Receiver nodes to the barrier and to the car that will communicate: the barrier could emit continuously a message indicating its status open/closed or the car could request the status when it approaches

`@PÃ∏ÃîÕêoÃ¥ÕëÃçiÃµÕóÕùnÃ∏ÃÑÃõtÃ∂ÕåÕÑ`: depending on what you want to achieve, you may use Receiver and Emitter nodes.


`@yash`: I would recommend you to define it arbitrarily as a small Sphere if needed (but this normally not needed).

##### Stefania Pedrazzi [cyberbotics] 05/11/2020 13:25:41
Hi `@Weiyi`, VRML is a graphical modeling language and doesn't have the notion of bounding object or physical properties, so it is not possible to import VRML models in Webots that already have bounding objects and physics properties set. But you have to set them directly in Webots.

##### Weiyi 05/11/2020 13:30:23
Sorry I' new to webots, should I add bounding object and physical properties in every Transform shown in my screenshot or  rebuild the whole track using webots?

##### Stefania Pedrazzi [cyberbotics] 05/11/2020 13:32:40
You can add the bounding objects and physical nodes in the imported Transform nodes. Note that static objects doesn't need physical nodes but only bounding objects.

If you are new to Webots I recommend you to look at this Tutorial: [https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/tutorial-5-compound-solid-and-physics-attributes](https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/tutorial-5-compound-solid-and-physics-attributes)

##### Jeremy Jiang 05/11/2020 14:10:17
Hello, I have built a world in Webots, and there are many objects such as obscles and balls (not robots). I want to create a controller for this world. By this controller, we can get information such as whether the obscles are collided or the positions of different objects all the time. How can I realize this goal? Is it possible to directly build a supervisor node and create the supervisor controller to realize my function?

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 05/11/2020 14:11:31
Yes the Supervisor is the way to go, from the supervisor controller you can monitor the position of the objects and even move them, create new ones, remove some etc.

`@lojik` that should not be possible indeed. Maybe one explanation could be that the resolution of the video is smaller than your regular resolution.

`@jomell310` as any regular controller process the supervisor is launched by Webots.

`@kwy`: it should be possible to draw simple 3D graphs such as yours using a HTML canvas and no WebGL. If you don't want to write your own 3D drawing functions, you can use some js libraries such as phoria.js: [http://www.kevs3d.co.uk/dev/phoria/](http://www.kevs3d.co.uk/dev/phoria/)

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 05/12/2020 07:51:55
`wb_supervisor_node_get_position` should return the absolute position.


`wb_supervisor_field_get_sf_vec3f` should return the relative position.

##### Jeremy Jiang 05/12/2020 08:12:27
Well, thank you for your answer.In fact, maybe I know the reason why I cannot get the global position of the transform node. this model is created in the form of vrml using other software and then  imported as a whole. So when I use the api wb\_supervisor\_node\_get\_position , the result is (0,0,0). In this case, How can I get the realistic global position the transform node?

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 05/12/2020 08:19:23
Can you compare it from what you get in the 'position' tab of the node editor (bottom part of the scene-tree) ?

Do you mean this? They are the same. (0,0,0)

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 05/12/2020 08:28:18
Yes exactly. In that case it perfectly make sense to get (0,0,0) from the supervisor too. It seems the problem is more on your hierarchy side.

##### Jeremy Jiang 05/12/2020 08:39:59
Sorry, I don't understand what you mean... The model created using other software is imported as a whole  and all the transform nodes in the model are all (0,0,0). For example, the transform node is exactly the cuboid in this picture. I created a ball on this cuboid, the position of the transform node should be exactly close to the ball. However, the position of the ball is about (0.33, 0.18, 1.68) while the node is (0,0,0).

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 05/12/2020 08:43:42
This just means that the points of the indexedFaceSet are not correctly centered around the origin of your node, but the origin of the node is still 0,0,0


It might be possible to correct this in your other software directly (I am usign Blender for example and it is possible).

##### Jeremy Jiang 05/12/2020 09:38:01

`@jomell310` probably that your supervisor is not detecting the event correctly, have you tried printing something when it is supposed to stop the simulation?

`@Rugnir` unfortunately object are visible only when you are outside of them so what you did is the only 'simple solution'. To have a better solution (but more complex to setup) you can once your viewpoint is below the surface of the water add a 'water plane' in front of the viewpoint (you will have to move the plane at each step so that it follows the viewpoint).

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 05/13/2020 07:03:02
Hi `@Weiyi` Weiyi. This is probably due to the fact that your bounding object is an IndexedFaceSet. Depending on the resolution of the IndexedFaceSet (size of the triangles), this kind of problem may appear. I would recommend you to replace the IndexedFaceSet with primitives nodes such as a Plane or a series of Boxes which you can arrange inside a Group node that contains Transform nodes containing the Box Shapes, so that you can use as many boxes as you want at different positions.

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 05/13/2020 07:09:32
Can the hole be a rectangle or a square?


Or do you want it circular?

##### Weiyi 05/13/2020 07:10:26
I hope it's a circle


but it seems difficult to make a circle hole... do you have any advice?

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 05/13/2020 07:12:18
Yes, you should use a SolidPipe proto: [https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/object-solids#solidpipe](https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/object-solids#solidpipe) with large thickness parameter.


That will make a round table with a circular hole at the middle.


Then, you can add boxes around it if you need to have a rectangular table.

##### Weiyi 05/13/2020 07:15:40
OK, I will try it, thank you  very much for your help!!!


Hello, what's the meaning of these points? If I add more points, will the situation I mentioned just now get better?

These are the points of your mesh.

##### TheOrangeOne 05/13/2020 07:48:13
> `@TheOrangeOne` can you be a bit more precise? What do you mean by `camera.get_orientation`, are you using the ROS controller? Or the Supervisor API to get the orientation of a node? Or something else?

`@David Mansolino` Sorry, I'm using a regular controller and the Python API. The orientation is coming via the camera recognition API, looking at a solid node.

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 05/13/2020 07:52:02
Ok, then the orientation is defined as axis angle. Like for the 'rotation' fields in Webots.

##### TheOrangeOne 05/13/2020 07:59:11
But there's 3 axis, and 4 values?

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 05/13/2020 08:00:37
[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axis%E2%80%93angle\_representation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axis%E2%80%93angle_representation)

##### TheOrangeOne 05/13/2020 08:14:45
That mentions 3 values?

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 05/13/2020 08:15:08
3 to define the rotation axis and one for the angle

##### TheOrangeOne 05/13/2020 08:22:09
Is that easily converted so a plain rotation around X,Y,Z etc? Assume I need to do something with the angle to get that?

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 05/13/2020 08:22:53
Yes of course, I am sure you will find all the required formula on internet, these conversions are pretty standard

open -a webots--stream ?

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 05/13/2020 10:07:31
`webots --stream="port=1234;monitorActivity"`

##### Dobby 05/13/2020 11:40:56
Yeah! We work together with electrical engineers for our University project and they asked if it is possible to use this physical controller on the robot through a localhost with the use of JS


We allready have a edited version of the thymio2 controller working perfectly and they wondered if they can somehow control it the same way but with a physical controller

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 05/13/2020 11:55:22
That is indeed possible, but you will have to write a Webots controller that will do the bridge between the simulated robot and the physical controller

##### yash 05/13/2020 12:01:57
My robot (differential drive) weighs 750gm , so according the torque required by each motor can be Calculated from T= umg, where u is the friction between wheels and rectangular arena, m is the mass of the robot , g is acceleration due to gravity.

So can I use this relation T= umg, to set the max torque in device parameters and the friction in contact materials?


Sorry the equation should be  T = r*umg , where r = radius of wheel


Because when I set the values calculated from above , it doesn‚Äôt work !

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 05/13/2020 12:07:56
What do you mean by 'it doesn't work', what is the behavior? And what is the desired behavior?

##### yash 05/13/2020 12:08:15
The robot doesn‚Äôt move

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 05/13/2020 12:09:18
Maybe you forget to take something else into account, like for example the wheel joint friction, etc.

##### yash 05/13/2020 12:10:52
One more thing the wheels do rotate


But the robot doesn‚Äôt move

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 05/13/2020 12:19:28

Yes !

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 05/13/2020 12:20:56
In that case the coulombFriction is probably too low

Probably yes, but I am not an expert in friction.

Hello, I take the opportinity that you are on the subject. Do you know where we can find good values for both friction and forceDependentSlip ?



I have a four wheels robot. My expectation is that when I would like to turn on spot using differential wheels it will turn. Then if I put it on a slope it will continues to turn on spot until a certain angle of the slope where it will begin to slide.



Actually, with webots, it begins to slide at a constant speed as soon as there is a slope.

`@lojik` it all depends on your robot, but it doesn't always slide, see for example the 'accelerometer' world, where a differential wheeled robot rotates on a slope: [https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/samples-devices#accelerometer-wbt](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/samples-devices#accelerometer-wbt)

But just now my own world can also connect to the streaming viewer.

So the problem is ‚Ä¶ my Mac need to have a break.

And I have found, streaming viewer is not so smooth like webots screen.

So I decide to use its own robot-window.

It can display 3D graph with vis.js

`@David Mansolino` Thank you for your answer, I did not see this example. Unfortunately it does not work anymore if we put the basicTimeStep to 1ms. If I understand it correctly, it means that the physics behind the simulation has some errors due to a too high timeStep.

`@lojik` yes the basic time step may in rare case influence the calibration of the friction, but even with a smaller time step you should be able to find some parameters that works for your case.


> how to convert wgs84 coordinate to local coordinate without changing coordinate system in world info? like i want to pass since wgs84 coordinate and convert it into local coordinate

`@Lussfer` In that case you have to convert them in your controller, here is the code in Webots that allows to make the conversion, you can probably take inspiration from it: [https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots/blob/565b5aed95a2aadb73bccf2ad733d37893d5edfe/src/webots/nodes/WbGps.cpp#L85-L106](https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots/blob/565b5aed95a2aadb73bccf2ad733d37893d5edfe/src/webots/nodes/WbGps.cpp#L85-L106)

I want to create a webgl based simulation which could just run like any other webgl application - "No add-ons, just the browser"

After referring to the materials provided on the documentation section, I found a paragraph saying



"

Chrome: launch with the --allow-file-access-from-files option

Firefox:

Open Firefox browser and in the address bar type about:config,

hit Enter button and click on I'll be careful, I promise!.

Search for privacy.file\_unique\_origin or security.fileuri.strict\_origin\_policy and double click on it to change the status from true to false.

"



Link: [https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/web-scene](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/web-scene)


I want to know that isn't there any other option available? Since this part "--allow-file-access-from-files: turns your browser very vulnerable to attacks.



Also, do you have any idea of how to create a javascript block of code handling this to turn on and turn off automatically whenever calling the .html webpage?


Has anyone gone through the procedure of exporting your Webots file to a webgl file?

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 05/13/2020 15:42:46
The tricks for Chrome and Firefox are only if you want to open the webgl page locally (with a `file://` URL). When you publish it on the web, e.g., with a `http(s)://` URL, you don't need these tricks.

##### Rajesh Roy 05/13/2020 15:55:21

The refresh rate of the default robot windows is not configurable, but you can get the data from your controller at the rate you want and save them to a file

hi there. if i use the supervisor to track the position of a robot. is it possible to send the position information to another controller?

##### brianne.byer 05/16/2020 12:40:16
Is there code available online that directly controls the wheels of the youbot? I mean, instead of what the webot demo uses (keyboard control)? The idea is for the youbot to follow a black, straight line. I'm also curious if I am required to add 4 hingejoints to the body slot of youbot. Thanks in advance, it is greatly appreciated as I am very new to coding.

Hello, I'm working on a room-mapping robot for my final year project and was wondering if it is possible to get the grid that the robot is currently on? I'm trying to do a very basic 2d array as a topological map?


> hi there. if i use the supervisor to track the position of a robot. is it possible to send the position information to another controller?

`@AyresAlmada` Did you ever find if this was possible? At least getting the robots position?


`@AyresAlmada` I know you can use GPS but I'm not entirely sure how I would translate the GPS into an X,Y position that can then go into a 2d array

##### dralorg 05/18/2020 00:31:15
Hi, I'm running the Youbots back wheels but the robot isn't moving. (The top wheels do make the robot move).



I've added the "contactProperties" inside the "WorldInfo" tag in the world file, this is what I've added.



```
  contactProperties [
    ContactProperties {
      material1 "InteriorWheelMat"
      coulombFriction [
        1.8, 0, 0.2
      ]
      frictionRotation -0.9648 0
      bounce 0
      forceDependentSlip [
        10, 0
      ]
    }
    ContactProperties {
      material1 "ExteriorWheelMat"
      coulombFriction [
        1.8, 0, 0.2
      ]
      frictionRotation 0.9648 0
      bounce 0
      forceDependentSlip [
        10, 0
      ]
    }
  ]
```



Why the bottom wheels are not making the robot move?

> hi there. if i use the supervisor to track the position of a robot. is it possible to send the position information to another controller?

`@AyresAlmada` yes of course, you can use an emitter to send it from your supervisor and a receiver node to receive it in your other controller.


> Is there code available online that directly controls the wheels of the youbot? I mean, instead of what the webot demo uses (keyboard control)? The idea is for the youbot to follow a black, straight line. I'm also curious if I am required to add 4 hingejoints to the body slot of youbot. Thanks in advance, it is greatly appreciated as I am very new to coding.

`@brianne.byer` sure, here is an example: [https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots/blob/master/projects/robots/kuka/youbot/libraries/youbot\_control/src/base.c](https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots/blob/master/projects/robots/kuka/youbot/libraries/youbot_control/src/base.c)

About the HingeJoint, you can indeed add them directly in the body slot as you would do with a regular chidren field (if not already done I would suggest to read this tutorial: [https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/tutorial-6-4-wheels-robot](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/tutorial-6-4-wheels-robot))

##### Jatin Sharma 05/18/2020 06:03:41
Hi, we are trying to simulate a simple robot in Webot with two rear driving wheels. To make it simpler among our interdisciplinary team we decided to choose python as the controller language. We are stuck with simple logic like PWM implementation, most of the sample code are written in C/C++ , shall we change it to C or there is some supporting database out there that we have not looked for. We are struggling with this sort of issue from a couple of weeks. Any suggestions would be highly appreciated. Thanks

> On webots i see that the object recognition is giving. X as Z, Y as Y and Z as -X. on webots does rotation match the orientations..

`@Mathie20` Yes the orientations match the 'rotation' field.

Abotu the axes inversion, I can't unfortunately reproduce this in the 'camera\_recognition' sample, do you have a specific case to reproduce this? Note that the position is expressed in the camera frame and not i nthe robot or world frame.

`@Jatin Sharma` hi, in webots you don't need to implement PWM, you can directly control the motors in speed or position, I would recommend to follow our tutorials (available in Python) to get familiar with controller programming in Webots: [https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/tutorial-1-your-first-simulation-in-webots?tab-language=python](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/tutorial-1-your-first-simulation-in-webots?tab-language=python)

`@Conor` To get the position  of the robot you can use the GPS device or the Supervisor API. Both methods will give you the global 3D position, to map it to a XY grid map (or XZ using the default Webots coordinate system) you can simply discard the Y value.  I suggest you to check this sample simulation for an example about getting the robot position: [https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/samples-devices#gps-wbt](https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/samples-devices#gps-wbt)

`@Lussfer` here are some path plannign example in Webots: [https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Cyberbotics%27\_Robot\_Curriculum/Advanced\_Programming\_Exercises#Path\_planning\_](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Cyberbotics%27_Robot_Curriculum/Advanced_Programming_Exercises#Path_planning_)[Advanced]

Unfortunately none of them is using pure pursuit.


`@dralorg` this might be due to the fact that the center of mass of the robot is not centered but rather to the front.

`@elkelkmuh` the gait algorithm of the darwin-op is not maid to climb stairs, unfortunately you will have to write your own gait algorithm if you want to climb stairs.

`@Rodeknopje` in that case you should use the `Robot.getInertialUnit` method ([https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/robot?tab-language=python#wb\_robot\_get\_device](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/robot?tab-language=python#wb_robot_get_device)).

You can set the size of the tiles for the floor. So I was wondering if it is possible to programmatically get the number of tiles or the size of the floor?

##### Stefania Pedrazzi [cyberbotics] 05/18/2020 16:03:59
Yes. You can compute it. For example if you are using the Rectangle arena, you can use the Supervisor API to get the `floorSize` and `floorTileSize`. Dividing the size by the tile size you get the number of tiles.

Hello! I modeled the ElcBot robot in Webots ([https://tinyroboticsteam.github.io/ElcBot/](https://tinyroboticsteam.github.io/ElcBot/)), the source codes are located here: [https://github.com/Ronin52/WeBots\_graduation\_project](https://github.com/Ronin52/WeBots_graduation_project). During testing, it turned out that when the robot stands still (does not move), it twitches. The wheel sinks into the floor. A video of how it works was posted on the link to instagram: [https://www.instagram.com/p/CAVkbXNDKti/?utm\_source=ig\_web\_copy\_link](https://www.instagram.com/p/CAVkbXNDKti/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link). Everything is fine while the robot is moving. Please tell me what this may be related to? I also get this warning: "WARNING: The current physics step could not be calculated correctly. Your world may be too complex. If this problem persists, try simplifying your bounding object(s), reducing the number of joints, or reducing WorldInfo.basicTimeStep"


Changing the WorldInfo.basicTimeStep parameter did not improve the result

`@Conor`: you can use both robot and supervisor API functions in a robot controller which has the `Robot.supervisor` flag set to `TRUE`.

I assume it's a single line?


Robot.supervisor = TRUE?

Yes, but in the world file (.wbt), not in the controller program.


(and there is no equal sign)

`@dralorg` Webots is indeed very realistic üòâ


> Hey hi How do I load PROTO file in webots

`@Musaab` like any regular node, you can simply use the add node dialog window.


> Hello, I am having trouble using the Robot.getTime function. When trying to store the time (time = robot.getTime), the function is not returning the time. Instead the variable 'time' above contains the method object. Any suggestions?

`@davisUndergrad` this is because it is a function you have to use it like this:

```
time = robot.getTime()
```


> hi there. i want to build a bridge in Webots, but have no idea about use which nodes. Any suggestions?

`@AyresAlmada` here is a tutorial showing how to build new objects:

[https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/tutorial-5-compound-solid-and-physics-attributes](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/tutorial-5-compound-solid-and-physics-attributes)

Since your bridge will be a static object, you should not put any 'Physics' node.

Note also that this world contains some bridges: [https://cyberbotics.com/doc/automobile/highway](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/automobile/highway)

(and attach webots)

##### Luiz Felipe 05/19/2020 06:01:10
If I run 'ls -la' the name of the executable is 'webots'. I tried to start gdb with 'gdb ./webots', 'gdb ./webots-bin'... I also tried to use 'file' inside the gdb to change the command but got the same error.


I checked, it exists a 'webots' executable in /usr/local/webots folder and a 'webots-bin' in the /usr/local/webots/bin folder. Also correcting the libraries path to /usr/local/webots/lib/webots and running 'gdb ./webots-bin' again from my /bin folder it works. It shows the ERROR: Webots has not been started regularly.

but works. I think the path in the [https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/troubleshooting](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/troubleshooting) troubleshooting page leads to the executable launcher?

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 05/19/2020 06:33:24
The page says to start `gdb ./webots-bin` which is the executable and not the launcher (`webots` is the launcher).

About the `ERROR: Webots has not been started regularly. Please start Webots from its launcher.` you can indeed ignore it, this is normal when debugging.

##### Luiz Felipe 05/19/2020 06:35:39
yups. The path /usr/local/webots leads to the launcher what can be misleading. The correct paths in my environment were /usr/local/webots/bin and /usr/local/webots/lib/webots. Thanks!!

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 05/19/2020 06:41:37
you're right, let me fix this!


This is probably more correct, right?

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 05/19/2020 07:12:06
`@Luiz Felipe`: it could be that your simulation is reaching edge conditions for ODE, like very large speeds, deep collisions, unstabilities, etc. Do you get any warning in the Webots console before the crash?

##### Luiz Felipe 05/19/2020 07:15:56
`@Olivier Michel`  Hi Olivier! Its highly likely that is what is happening in the simulation (large speeds, deep collisions, unstabilities). The GDB freezed webots right before crashing and I did not observed any warning in the console. Usually the 'WARNING: The current physics step could not be computed correctly. Your world may be too complex. If this problem persists, try simplifying your bounding object(s), reducing the number of joints, or reducing WorldInfo.basicTimeStep.' happens during my simulation.

`@jomell310` this is because the Supervisor class inherits from the Robot class, so if you instantiate one Supervisor you should not instantiate any Robot.


`@AyresAlmada` you're welcome


> Hello, I wonder if I can export objects in webots to stl files, obj files, 3D studio files(3ds) or Direct 3D files?

`@Weiyi` no, only to VRML (and then you can find some other software such as Blender for example, that convert VRML to something else), but be careful to the license.

`@nap` this error simply means that the controllers send a position request that is slightly out of range of the motor.


> Hello everybody! Please help me write a PROTO of a wheel similar to the one in the screenshot. That is, the wheel rotates on an axis, and the axis with the wheel rotates in around the other axis.

If this problem persists, try simplifying your bounding object(s), reducing the number of joints, or reducing WorldInfo.basicTimeStep"

`@Ronin52` to simulate this kind of wheel you usually have to use 2 HingeJoint instead of a Hinge2joint, here is an example: 

```
DEF CASTER_WHEEL_FRONT_RIGHT_JOINT HingeJoint {
  jointParameters HingeJointParameters {
    axis 0 0 1
    anchor 0.1695 -0.102 -0.0335

  ]
  endPoint DEF CASTER_WHEEL_FRONT_RIGHT Solid {
    translation 0.1695 -0.102 -0.0335
    rotation 0 0 1 0
    children [
      DEF SMALL_WHEEL_JOINT HingeJoint {
        jointParameters HingeJointParameters {
          axis 0 1 0

        ...
        }
      }
      ...
    ]
  }
}
```

In any case, the warning that you are seeing just means that the physics engine encounter some instabilities, but in most of the cases if you just get a few of them you can ignore them.

`@PurplePi` Then you should use a IPC method (like using the Emitter/Receiver nodes) to let the Supervisor controller notify the robot controllers about the reset so that they can execute the initialization function.


The other option to automatically notify them, is to restart the robots controllers.

##### PurplePi 05/20/2020 08:34:36

##### Stefania Pedrazzi [cyberbotics] 05/20/2020 09:02:53
Hi `@cakar`, the Fluid node is just a functional node and has no graphical appearance. You have to add the Shape node in the children field to visualize it. Here is a sample simulation: [https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/samples-geometries#floating\_geometries-wbt](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/samples-geometries#floating_geometries-wbt)


For simulating fluid on the floor, where the objects are not immersed in it, I don't think that the Fluid node is the best option. I would rather display it on the floor like a graphical effect and then adjust the ContactProperties

My end users are not familiar with setting environment variables in linux/windows. Is there a workaround for that? The ${WEBOTS\_HOME}/lib/controller/python3X folder is created after the python version is detected in the user's computer?

> `@nap` this error simply means that the controllers send a position request that is slightly out of range of the motor.

`@David Mansolino` :  Should I get the warning when the controller is set to `void`? (In fact the warning seems to be issued before the world is ready to start executing after a reload.)

Can the warning be fixed by editing the PROTO?

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 05/20/2020 14:40:14
No you should not get it with the `void` controller.

Did you somehow saved the world after it has run?

##### nap 05/20/2020 14:41:53
> No you should not get it with the `void` controller.

> Did you somehow saved the world after it has run?

`@David Mansolino` : That may be the problem.  I just loaded the original but local copy of the Tower\_of\_Hanoi world and the warning did not show.  (I'll debug it and come back.)


> Did you somehow saved the world after it has run?

> `@David Mansolino` : Yes, that was it.  There were a bunch of `hidden position, hidden linearVelocity, hidden angularVelocity, hidden rotation` nodes saved into the WBT file.  Thanks!!

##### chungshan 05/22/2020 05:34:07
Hello, I import a vrml file to the webot. It is a bottle created in Solidworks. First, I convert this bottle to Solid node. I set the boundingObject to IndexedFaceSet of this bottle. However, the bottle is floating and it shows "WARNING: The current physics step could not be computed correctly. Your world may be too complex. If this problem persists, try simplifying your bounding object(s), reducing the number of joints, or reducing WorldInfo.basicTimeStep." How can I fix this?
> **Attachment**: [bottle\_floating.mp4](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/565154703139405824/713263404667764766/bottle_floating.mp4)

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 05/22/2020 06:30:43
`@ChapoGuzman`: you should proceed step-by-step to create a simple robotics arm, with only one joint at the beginning, then two, etc. Also, you should use simple primitives, like boxes, cylinders before importing 3D shapes from SolidWorks. That will help you understand how Webots models are implemented and you will be able in a later stage to import shapes from SolidWorks.


`@Alfian`: the model is available here: [https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots/blob/master/projects/robots/dji/mavic/protos/Mavic2Pro.proto](https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots/blob/master/projects/robots/dji/mavic/protos/Mavic2Pro.proto)


`@jiang`: this floor is not "soft". The softness you seems to observe is due to the WorldInfo ([https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/worldinfo](https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/worldinfo)) parameters. See [https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/modeling#my-robot-sinks-into-the-ground-how-to-remove-this-effect](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/modeling#my-robot-sinks-into-the-ground-how-to-remove-this-effect) for a solution to this problem.


`@G1020BS`: This world file [https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots/blob/master/projects/samples/howto/worlds/vision.wbt](https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots/blob/master/projects/samples/howto/worlds/vision.wbt) is a demo of using OpenCV with a Webots controller. The controller itself and Makefile are located in [https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots/tree/master/projects/samples/howto/controllers/vision](https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots/tree/master/projects/samples/howto/controllers/vision). This should help you.


`@Troy`: you should increase the resolution of your Display device (width and height).


`@kzooi`: is it your controller crashing or Webots? If Webots, please post a bug report on GitHub with all the information allowing us to reproduce the crash.


`@riddlefive`: Please share a sample source code on your GitHub issue showing the problem.


`@chungshan`: You should avoid using complex meshes as bounding objects as they generate instabilities due to their complexity. Instead, you should create a composite bounding object made up of a Group node containing several Transform nodes. Each Transform should contain a translation, rotation and a children which should be a simple Shape (like a Sphere, a Capsule, a Box or a Cylinder).


See for example: [https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/tutorial-5-compound-solid-and-physics-attributes#compound-solid](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/tutorial-5-compound-solid-and-physics-attributes#compound-solid)

I want to track the position of the robot in the environment. I am using odometry for this purpose. So I want to produce a graph of the robot path . How can this graph be plotted .?

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 05/22/2020 07:27:40
Then, you should debug your controller to understand where and why it crashes. You can use printf (and start Webots with the --stderr --stdout options) or use gdb: see [https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/debugging-c-cpp-controllers](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/debugging-c-cpp-controllers)


`@yash`: you can use a robot window to plot your graph.


See example  in `WEBOTS_HOME/projects/samples/howto/worlds/custom_html_robot_window.wbt`.


Then, you will have to use a HTML canvas or a js library.

##### yash 05/22/2020 07:34:31
Alright , then what about the display node .?

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 05/22/2020 07:44:13
Yes, that's another option.


For the robot window, a good js plotting library is vis.js for example ([https://visjs.org](https://visjs.org)).

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 05/22/2020 09:41:36
You simply need to install OpenCV (see the Makefile of the robot controller)

i already did that


so idk why its not working

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 05/22/2020 09:46:23
Then you need to recompile the robot controller.

##### Quantumfox 05/22/2020 09:46:33
with the gearwheel

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 05/22/2020 09:46:59
Yes, or by typing make in a MSYS2 console.

##### Quantumfox 05/22/2020 09:47:07

so thats why its so strange


i also put the opencv into path variables with

yes i guess the controller is using also version 4

\#include <opencv2/core/core.hpp>

\#include <opencv2/imgproc/imgproc.hpp>


when i search tutorials it also shows up like this when using version 4


but the example uses c++

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 05/22/2020 10:21:37
Look into the Makefile to understand why it doesn't find your installation of OpenCV.

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 05/22/2020 10:22:40
You should define the OpenCV installation path in `OPENCV_DIR` environment variable.

yes i see but already did that


but i delete it so not eveeryone will see my path

yes i know


but the file doesnt exist into the opencv

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 05/22/2020 11:32:46
you should have libopencv\_core430.dll somewhere in your opencv installation.


and also libopencv\_core.dll.a to link with gcc


How did you installed / compiled opencv?

##### Quantumfox 05/22/2020 11:34:17
i used the installer from the opencv website

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 05/22/2020 11:34:30
In MSYS2, they include these: [https://packages.msys2.org/package/mingw-w64-x86\_64-opencv](https://packages.msys2.org/package/mingw-w64-x86_64-opencv)


Maybe the package misses the gcc/msys2 lib files?

yeah i think it does

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 05/22/2020 11:37:42
So, you should download the same version from here: [http://repo.msys2.org/mingw/x86\_64/](http://repo.msys2.org/mingw/x86_64/)

`@Olivier Michel`

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 05/22/2020 15:18:49
It probably means that your controller is not calling wb\_robot\_step() with a strictly positive value.

##### Troy 05/22/2020 15:19:41
I wrote that     while (wb\_robot\_step(time\_step) != -1) {   

}

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 05/22/2020 15:22:18
You should debug your controller by putting printf with the time\_step value performed.

`@iagsav` As described in the Radar documentation ([https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/radar](https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/radar)) you should set the `radarCrossSection` field of your robot/object (or any Solid nodes that it is part of it) to a value greater than 0 in order to let the radar device detect it.

`@kwy` it looks like your robot slightly tilts itself (maybe when braking for example) and therfore the lidar is tilted too and therefore it see the ground.


`@benjovengo` instead of a light sensors, you probably want to use a distance-sensor (which can somehow sense colors too), here is an example of line following: [https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/epuck#e-puck\_line-wbt](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/epuck#e-puck_line-wbt)

`@hrsh12` You can either convert your car node to base node (right click on the node in the scene-tree) and then you will be able to change the structure, either change directly the Car.proto file.

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 05/25/2020 09:06:44
you can't use `FSRField =robot.getField('TouchSensor "LFsrFL"')`, you should use the getFromDef function:

Somthing such as:

```
FSRNode = robot.getFromDef('LFsrFL')  # the 'LFsrFL' DEF should be defined
postion = FSRNode.getPosition()
```

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 05/25/2020 09:37:01
ok in that case you should use the same for getting the foot node handle:

Thank you

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 05/26/2020 08:11:23
Hi `@lojik` current feedback is unfortunately not available yet in Webots. You can only get directly the torque and position feedback.

Sadly .. but I expected this answer after reading the doc. There is no way to deduce current/voltage from consumptionFactor?

`@David Mansolino`  how?

##### lojik 05/26/2020 10:24:47
You can have a variable like elapsedTime. You increment it with timestep for each basictimestep. And having a main while loop like :



while controller.step() != -1 and elapsedTime <= 2000:

 ...


But it will not completely stop the simulation. It will stop you controller and the behavior of the simulation is unpredictable when it stop itself.

I am thinking about doing an ML CV project in Webots and I was wondering if it is possible. Here is the background: I want to detect shadows of hills and explore the terrain. I would run the simulation until the robot gets stuck on the hill. How would I keep track of how long it took for the robot to get stuck if I just want it to record a lot of data automatically?

Also, are neuromorphic sensors available in Webots/


?

##### AngelAyala 05/27/2020 00:49:29
`@Clara Cardoso Ferreira`  I think you must program the sensor using a camera, I'm new eith webots, but I does not have seen that kind of sensor

Thanks `@AngelAyala` . I talked to someone and found out that I could translate RGB camera values into neuromorphic data (event based)


I would do that with HOTS algorithm after I get RGB images. 



After some thought about the question I was wondering earlier:

If I want to collect a bunch of data (time it took for simulation to run),  would it be possible to set an initial condition pattern for the robot to follow so that every time the robot recognizes it got stuck it could restart the simulation from the beginning with new initial conditions?

`@Rhino` are you using ROS1 or ROS2 ?

IF you are using ros1, you probably don't need to move anything, you simply need to assign the 'ros' controller to on of the robot of your simulation world.

##### Rhino 05/28/2020 14:53:15

You can simply add an empty 'Robot' node and set the controller of this 'empty' robot to ros, this wqy, this robot can do the bridge between ros and your other robots


But if you are not using ros to control the robot, why do you want to integrate ros ?

Instead of modifying the sumo controller, you should rather already add the vehicle with the correct controller in your simulation and set the appropriate DEF name so that the sumo supervisor will use it when needed: [https://cyberbotics.com/doc/automobile/sumo-interface#use-vehicles-already-present-in-the-world](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/automobile/sumo-interface#use-vehicles-already-present-in-the-world)

> What're the available values for the contactMaterial attr. in the Floor node ?

`@Samir Hosny Mohamed` you can define the name of the contact material from the 'Floor' node, then in the WorldInfo.contactProperties you can define the properties.


> Hallo, how to install numpy for python(snap)

`@kwy` if you need to install numpy, you should either use another package of Webots than snap either use external controller: [https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/running-extern-robot-controllers](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/running-extern-robot-controllers)


> someone know how to change names in the scene tree?

`@Iguins` you can't change the 'Solid' part as it show the type of node, but you can change the 'DEF' name from the node editor just below the scene-tree

`@Samir Hosny Mohamed` touch sensors works exactly the same way as the other sensors, you can get a handle to the sensor using it$s name.

`@Rodeknopje` yes, if you don't but any motor, the joint will be free and move according to physical constraints.

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 06/02/2020 15:15:36
Hey `@David Mansolino`  do you guys have benchmarks, showing the performance & accuracy compared to other simulators / physics engines? I'm curious as to how your flavour of ODE is different

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 06/02/2020 15:16:25
Hi `@Simon Steinmann`. Unfortunately, we don't have such benchmarks.

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 06/02/2020 15:17:02
Also, you use a fairly large default step time. of 8-16ms, compared to gazebo with 1ms. Is there any special sauce? I read and heared that you are 100% deterministic.

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 06/02/2020 15:17:19
We modified ODE to produce better contact points that yields to a better stability. Also, we added fluid dynamics and multi-threading, fixed some collision functions, etc.


True, if your simulation is designed carefully, it should be 100% deterministic.

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 06/02/2020 15:18:22
I send you a friend request, would like to pm you about a project

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 06/02/2020 15:18:40
The default time step of 8 or 16 ms works in many simulation setups and is way faster that 1 ms.


OK.

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 06/02/2020 16:08:59
Does webots use any GPU acceleration for simulation? Or just for rendering

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 06/02/2020 16:09:17
No it uses GPU for simulation as well.


Mainly for simulating cameras, range-finders and lidars.

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 06/02/2020 16:24:06
Yes, it relies on the direct velocity control of ODE which is very stable.

ah, but there is some form of PID controller in the engine then?! Otherwise that would cause troubles wouldnt it?

Yes.

gotcha, thanks for clarifying


Is it possible to export a .proto in urdf format? For ROS the robot\_description is loaded into the parameter server, which IK software like MoveIT and tools like Rviz use. With robots that webots natively supports like the universal robots, the urdf used by ROS is different to the modified model in webots.


If not urdf, perhaps .stl or .dae files

AAny guidance that you guys can provide will be of great help

##### Clara Cardoso Ferreira 06/03/2020 05:04:31
Im not sure, but my guess is that the reference point is which coordinate do you want the gps to reference the robot, is it the center of the robot? if so, I think you want it to be 0,0,0?

##### dimple.bhuta 06/03/2020 05:04:56
I tried that but it did not work

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 06/03/2020 05:35:56
`@dimple.bhuta` if you set it to 'local' it will just return the X-Y-Z coordinate of the GPS in the Webots reference frame.


if you set it to 'WGS84', then it will return the latitude, longitude and altitude of the GPS.


In that case it is important to set the 'gpsReference' as it will define the latitude, longitude and altitude of the origin (0, 0, 0) of your simulation world.

##### dimple.bhuta 06/03/2020 05:37:10
Ok but the coordinates arn't matching vehicle position. The reference that was generated using transforms and the car goes off-course.


Ok

Note also that 'northDirection' matter as it indicate which direction point to the north and therefor which direction is latitude and which direction is longitude


> David, thanks for the guidance with helping me implement the uneven terrain proto.

`@Clara Cardoso Ferreira` did you use it for the bounding object too?

##### dimple.bhuta 06/03/2020 05:39:17

> How is dynamic friction handled in webots?  I can set the coloumbFriction, but what happens once it starts slipping? The dynamic friction coefficient is usually different than the static one.

`@Simon Steinmann` you will find more about this topic in the ODE (our physic engine) manual: [http://ode.org/wiki/index.php?title=Manual#Friction\_Approximation](http://ode.org/wiki/index.php?title=Manual#Friction_Approximation)


> So if I set my gps to local the north direction adjustment would be all (0,0,0)

`@dimple.bhuta` if you set it to local it just means that it will simply return X,Y,Z position in meter (which are the deviation from the reference point).

##### Clara Cardoso Ferreira 06/03/2020 05:43:17

`@David Mansolino` not sure what you are talking about. Are you asking if I set the meshes like in tutorial 2 with the ball? If so, I did not

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 06/03/2020 05:45:14
In Webots meshes are used for two purpose, for visualization (including sensors such as camera, lidar, etc.) and for the physics (basically collision detection). The first one is used when you specify it in a Shape node and the second one is used when you specify it in the boundingObject field of a Solid node.

##### Clara Cardoso Ferreira 06/03/2020 05:50:46
`@David Mansolino` Im still a little bit lost as to what to do to the uneven terrain so that the robot interacts with it, sorry. The terrain is currently above the robots (cant reach).

##### Stefania Pedrazzi [cyberbotics] 06/03/2020 11:46:49
`@Professor Felix`, do you mean the camera feedback in the view with a magenta border? This is called "Overlay" and should be enabled by default. If it is not (maybe it was closed in a previous run of the simulation), you can enable it by right-clicking on the robot (from the 3D view or scene tree) and selecting the "Overlays" item in the context menu and checking the camera item


Here is a screenshot of the context menu item to enable the camera overlay

> Hi guys, I used the truck.proto from Webots and controlled it via ros\_automobile before, and it worked very well. This time, I would like to create a tractor by myself and control it via ROS for a project. My question is, do I need to program a ros controller for this tractor by myself? I am following the Tutorial 6: 4-wheels robot, but I am not pretty clear about it. Thank you very much for your help.

`@John520` as long as your tractor is using on the Car PROTO ([https://cyberbotics.com/doc/automobile/car](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/automobile/car)) as root node, you can use the ros\_automobile controller. Otherwise you will either have to create your own controller either use the more generic 'ros' controller.

`@Clara Cardoso Ferreira`: it may be easier to install MSYS2 from msys2.org and type `pacman -S mingw-w64-x86_64-opencv` in the MSYS2 console to install it along with all the needed dependencies.

##### TheWiseSidney 06/04/2020 08:20:12
Sub guys, Im still working on  a school project in webots. We are using Opencv for object recognition but i cant get it to work. How do i include opencv, like the normal way you include libs in c++ or do you guys have support for that.

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 06/04/2020 08:39:55
It works the axact same way as for other libs, here is a simple guide: [https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/using-webots-makefiles#adding-an-external-library-ccp](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/using-webots-makefiles#adding-an-external-library-ccp)

##### Dobby 06/04/2020 08:47:05
Yeah that seemed to fix it, I changed my OPENCV\_DIR global value to the right map now, however we are still getting compile errors, hows it going for you? `@Clara Cardoso Ferreira`

##### ThomasH 06/04/2020 09:55:12
Hi all! I have a question concerning the access to a node within a robot. I added a Camera to the existing iCreate Robot PROTO and now I want to use the C++ API to read out the position and orientation of the camera. This code is working to access the out Robot's node:

auto rootBot = m\_robo->getFromDef("ROBOT1");



However, I always get null when I try to access the camera node:

auto cameraSolid = m\_robo->getFromDef("ROBOT1.CREATE\_CAMERA");



Here is the relevant section of the PROTO file:

PROTO CreateLPR [

  ...

]

{

Robot {

  translation IS translation

  rotation IS rotation

  children [

      ....

    DEF CREATE\_CAMERA Camera {

      translation 0 0.044 -0.172

      rotation IS camera\_rotation

      children [



...



Maybe someone has an idea what I do wrong. Thanks for your help!

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 06/04/2020 09:58:02
Yes, it doesn't work because your camera is inside a PROTO.


We introduced a new supervisor API function that allows you to get a handle to a node that is inside a proto.

##### ThomasH 06/04/2020 09:58:53
ah nice

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 06/04/2020 09:59:02

`@TheWiseSidney` the goal is not to compile OpenCV, you have to cmpile it before, the goal is to include and link with opencv.

##### ThomasH 06/04/2020 10:33:29
`@Olivier Michel` Its working with the getFromProtoDef() method. Thanks again for your help üëç

##### lojik 06/04/2020 11:50:17
Hey everyone, I do not fully understand something. If I set a new basicTimeStep by doing :



sup.getFromDef('world\_info').getField('basicTimeStep').setSFFloat(param.BASIC\_TIMESTEP)



Then if I do a sup.getBasicTimeStep() after, it will return the old basicTimeStep and not the new one just set before.



Is it normal?

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 06/04/2020 11:51:19
Yes, it is not recommended to change the time step while the simulation is running, this can cause some instabilities.

##### lojik 06/04/2020 11:54:29
My goal is to set the timestep with a constant in my controller parameters. So I can have some parameters in a python file and change them inside to influe the simulation. It will let me implement some grid search on parameters instead of changing them by hand for each simulations. I was thinking to set the world with these parameters and then do the steps simulation.


Is there an other way to do that? I do not would like to change the timestep in a simulation but between them.

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 06/04/2020 11:56:08
Ok, in that case what you are trying to do might work (even so the controller is not receiving the update). But I would rather use another methd not changing the timestep after the controllers started.


One possible solution, would be to have your controller 'write' your next world file (it can for example do a search and replace of the timestep value, or generate the world from a template), then your controller can use the 'wb\_supervisor\_world\_load' ([https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/supervisor#wb\_supervisor\_world\_load](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/supervisor#wb_supervisor_world_load)) function to load the new world.

##### lojik 06/04/2020 12:01:49
Ok, nice I will check that. Thank you üëç 



If I understand it right, the simulation is consider as started as soon as we load a world file? This is why the timestep is consider as "fixed" by the supervisor?

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 06/04/2020 12:03:28
> Ok, nice I will check that. Thank you üëç 

You're welcome!

> If I understand it right, the simulation is consider as started as soon as we load a world file? This is why the timestep is consider as "fixed" by the supervisor?

`@lojik` yes, some of the parameters which should remain constant while the simulation is running (very few are like this actually) are transferred to the controller only when it is started (this will minimize communication between the controller process and the Webots process and therefore improve performance).

##### lojik 06/04/2020 12:04:56
Is there a list somwhere about these parameters? So I will be able to search them into my .wbt file before running it and change the others parameters after with getFromDef(). Instead of changing all my parameters.

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 06/04/2020 12:05:49
Unfortunately not, however, as far as I rememeber, here are the main ones:


- worldInfo.timestep.  

- camera.width and height.

- Plugins (such as robot-window, physics plugins, remote-control).

##### lojik 06/04/2020 12:08:05
ok perfect, thank you üëç So I will check to change the timestep directly in .wbt files. This is the only one I change that seems to be done before loading the world.

> for practice i have replicated ros\_python world, i am trying to use a custom ros message but getting import error. the custom ros message is in catkin pakage. is it possible to use custom message in webots?

`@Lussfer` yes this is possible, however, you have to modify the runtime.ini file () to add the path to your custom ros message package path: [https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots/blob/master/projects/languages/ros/controllers/ros\_python/runtime.ini](https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots/blob/master/projects/languages/ros/controllers/ros_python/runtime.ini)


> Hello, I'm new here! simple question but how do I modify my lookup table for my little old DistanceSensor?

`@Jorrock [no]` you can simply modify it in the scene-tree, or if the DistanceSensor is defined in a PROTO file you will need to manually edit the file.

If you are new, I strongly recommend following the tutorials: [https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/tutorials](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/tutorials)

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 06/05/2020 10:16:35
Hi, we don't have more documentation than the one in the Webots reference manual. To get more information, you should look into the source code of our ODE fork.

I'm guessing the main application would be buoyancy and drag. But I'm guessing that is just approximations and for lower velocities? As proper CFD is quite complex and computationally intensive

Ok from a supervisor then, yes this is possible, but not so easy, you will have to parse the node tree from the supervisor and for each node you can check it's field.

how do I parse the node tree? I can't find the function for that

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 06/05/2020 11:56:54
You should get the 'children'/'endpoint' field of the current node, then get all the nodes in this field and do the same recursively on thoose nodes.

i also tried using `PYTHONPATH=/home/lussfer/catkin_ws/devel/lib/python3/dist-packages:/opt/ros/melodic/lib/python2.7/dist-packages:/home/lussfer/catkin_ws/src/webots_ros/msg`


since the custom\_msg.msg is in msg folder

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 06/05/2020 15:01:11
The `/home/lussfer/catkin_ws/src/webots_ros/msg` part looks useless as this are the sources, but the actuall python files should be located somewhere like `/home/lussfer/catkin_ws/devel/lib/python3/dist-packages`.

`@Lussfer` Yes exactly

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 06/05/2020 15:14:11
My runtime.ini looks like this:

`[environment variables with relative paths]

PYTHONPATH=$(PYTHONPATH):$(WEBOTS\_HOME)/projects/languages/ros/controllers/ros\_python/python/site-packages:$(WEBOTS\_HOME)/projects/languages/ros/controllers/ros\_python/kinetic/dist-packages



[environment variables]

ROS\_LOG\_DIR=ros\_python\_log

ROS\_PACKAGE\_PATH=$(ROS\_PACKAGE\_PATH):$(WEBOTS\_HOME)/projects/languages/ros/controllers/ros\_python/kinetic/share

ROS\_MASTER\_URI=http://localhost:11311`


if you open your terminal, source your workspace, then you can simply run webots from the terminal using 'webots'


it will then use your path definitions


this way you only have to edit the runtime.ini once. And you can use all packages you have in your ROS install

##### Lussfer 06/05/2020 15:15:58

let me know if it works

##### Lussfer 06/05/2020 15:16:41
for sure


`@Simon Steinmann` its recognizing my custom message now. Thank you. so apparently if i open webots by clicking the application icon it doesn't recognize my custom message but if i open webots through terminal as you said, it is recognizing the custom message


reverted back my runtime.ini file to what i originally had and still works if i open webots through terminal

Hello! I am using Python and i've been wondering if there's a way to pass object arguments (like a class object) to a robot's controller? I create the robot with importMFNodeFromString via a supervisor controller and i would like to initialize some objects there and pass them to the robot controller.

##### dimple.bhuta 06/06/2020 08:49:33
Hello I have gone through the documentation. I wanted to verify that the the rotational field of robots/vehicles is quaternions.


TeslaModel3 {

  translation 3.46 0.318652 -118.22

  rotation  -0.00487135 0.999985 0.00235245 1.57488

  name "agent\_0"

  controller "ros\_automobile"

  controllerArgs "--name=agent\_0 --clock --use-sim-time"

  sensorsSlotCenter [

    GPS {

    }

  ]

}


and if there is a reference code to obtain starting translational/rotational coordinates of a vehicle given consecutive reference x,y coordinates

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 06/06/2020 10:51:27
`@dimple.bhuta` It is not quaternion. This explains it: [https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/transform?tab-language=python](https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/transform?tab-language=python)


Can you elaborate your second question?

##### dimple.bhuta 06/06/2020 10:55:18
Okay so in the wbt file you specify the translation/rotation coordinates and car spawns at that particular location in the map. I am trying to write a code that generates the car during coding/real time and based on my coordinates *


(that I have of the road map)


i need to figure out the starting translation (i have figured this out). or rotation coordinates. So i am trying to write the code that calculates these and starts the car from the calculated position in the map.


Thank you for directing me towards the documentation


I am just confused about how to calculate rotation coordinates

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 06/06/2020 10:58:07
are you using a supervisor controller?

##### dimple.bhuta 06/06/2020 10:58:08
So if there is any documentation/formula to get those coordinates


yes

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 06/06/2020 10:58:49
I made a commit to the documentation, but it is not live yet. Take a look at this example code. Perhaps it will help

If you want to calculate the position and orientation of any node relative to any other node, you can take a look at this example in python. It should be easily adaptable to any other language, as it uses simple matrix and vector calculations.


that's what the code does

I create the robot with importMFNodeFromString via a supervisor controller and i would like to initialize some objects there and pass them to the robot controller.

`@Lifebinder (tsampazk)` when you import the robot you can set the `controllerArgs` field to set arguments of the controller in your import string. Would this be enough?

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 06/08/2020 06:27:57
Hi, the easiest way is to use a supervisor to reset the simulation. Or simply reset the robot to its initial position.

##### cakar 06/08/2020 06:28:37
what about during the simulation?

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 06/08/2020 06:29:03
Yes, that is during the simulation. Do you know what a supervisor is?

##### Stefania Pedrazzi [cyberbotics] 06/08/2020 07:40:30
Hi `@nelsondmmg`, you should decrease the `softCFM` value of the ContactProperties defined for the `ToyotaPriusWheels` material and the road material.  `softCFM 1e-05` is usually the correct value in the distributed examples. Did you modify the Prius car model?

##### nelsondmmg 06/08/2020 07:42:02
What do you mean by "Change the Prius car model"? Changes in the PROTO file? I don' think so.

##### Stefania Pedrazzi [cyberbotics] 06/08/2020 07:42:55
Yes, in the PROTO file  or if you added any heavy objects/devices to it (in the scene tree)

##### nelsondmmg 06/08/2020 07:43:37
No. I added only sensors (camera, GPS, receiver, emitter, IMU).

##### Stefania Pedrazzi [cyberbotics] 06/08/2020 07:44:35
Ok. If you set for example the softCFM value to 1e-06 you should immediately see a difference and the car should be lifted up a little bit (maybe enough).

##### nelsondmmg 06/08/2020 07:56:19
I changed to 1e-7 and the behavior remained the same. So I replace the Prius with a model 3 and it worked as it should. Thanks.

##### Stefania Pedrazzi [cyberbotics] 06/08/2020 08:09:30
Ok, so then the ContactProperties node doesn't target the correct material for your Prius model.

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 06/08/2020 08:18:11
The contact material for the prius is called 'ToyotaPriusWheels'.

##### Lifebinder (tsampazk) 06/08/2020 09:24:37

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 06/09/2020 05:08:15
`@elkelkmuh` you should make sure that your robot has an emitter device called 'emitter' and if not you can add one in the slot fields.


> `@David Mansolino` yes i tried, finally i figured out that this issue is only on C as in other languages as python the tag is a string, the only thing i dont get is why in C it has to be 1, what indicates that ?

`@black_hammer_67` that's strange, it shouldn't, escpecially because the Python API is calling the C one, so it is the exacte same function that is called at the end.

`@TheWiseSidney` Yes, what you did looks correct to use the python lib in C/C++, howerver, why not directly writting your controller in Python?

`@black_hammer_67` the front one should use a Hinge2Joint node instead of a simple 'HingeJoint' node. BUt an even better solution would be to use the AckermannVehicle node: [https://cyberbotics.com/doc/automobile/ackermannvehicle](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/automobile/ackermannvehicle)

if you use the receiver, fur sure you need it..

Hi `@Stanislas Larnier`, where does this model of the motoman gp8 arm comes from, did you created it yourself?

In any case, to make it static with the environment, the root Solid/Robot node should have a boundign object but no physics node (and all the childrens Solid nodes should have both).

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 06/09/2020 11:52:22
Yes, the same way as for the ackermannVehicle you can find an `extensionSlot` field allowing you to add more node.

##### Gautier A. 06/10/2020 08:48:54
So, I have a robot with the default ros controller with just a camera inside.


the controlleur has as controllerArgs " --use-sim-time "


I enable the camera with a rosservice call , and right after, call a rostopic hz on the topic of the camera, and it seems to publish at 125 hz

So my question would be : does the default ros controller really publish (by default) the camera topic at 125 hz ? If so, how can I diminish that update rate ?

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 06/10/2020 08:54:22
It will depend on the time step of the simulation and the speed at which run the simulation, but yes it is possible that it publishes at 125Hz. To reduce it, when you call the `/camera/enable` service, you should assigne a `value` to the service that is bigger (the value indicates the refresh period).

So, the publish rate expressed with 'rostopic hz ' is relative to the simulation time instead of ros time ? The timeStep is 8ms, and the simulation runs at 0.10x, so that would means that the topic is updated at around 12.5 hz ?

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 06/10/2020 08:59:01
It all depends if `rostopic hz` is configured to use sim time or not, but in your case it seems to be the case since 1000ms / 8ms = 125Hz (if it was based on the real time it would be indeed 12.5Hz if your simulation runs at 0.1x)

##### Gautier A. 06/10/2020 09:02:37

sometimes it works as intended, sometimes it returns None

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 06/10/2020 10:42:17
Are you sure the camera was enabled with the same time step as the control loop?


`wb_camera_enable(camera, 32);`

`wb_robot_step(32);`

##### Tosidis 06/10/2020 10:44:08
timestep = int(robot.getBasicTimeStep())

camera = robot.getCamera('camera')

camera.enable(timestep)


robot is my Supervisor

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 06/10/2020 10:59:20
Do you call the Robot.step() method with the timestep argument between calls to Camera.getImage()?

##### Stefania Pedrazzi [cyberbotics] 06/10/2020 12:54:51
Ok, so if it is a graphical Qt application the best approach would probably be to integrate it as a `robot window` controller plugin (note that this is deprecated and HTML/JS robot windows are preferred over Qt ones).

There are a couple of examples of Qt robot windows in the distributed samples, for example ` projects/robots/nex/plugins/robot_windows/fire_bird_6_window` used in this simulation [https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/firebird6#fire\_bird\_6-wbt](https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/firebird6#fire_bird_6-wbt)

I'm trying to model the Tesla Model 3 using a dynamic bicycle model, but there is still a performance difference which I cannot explain. For the motor propulsion, I accounted the motor output accordingly ( min value between maxT and the maxP expression, eletric motor), with aerodynamic force and the wheels resistance torque (with 4*c*w as wheel damping). I am for the moment maintaining the steering angle equal to zero, but for the slip friction a model F=c*alpha will be used. Am I forgetting some longitudinal component ?

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 06/11/2020 05:00:33
Hi `@Doc` unfortunately not out of the box, only the viewpoint can genereate video, and only one viewpoint per simulation is allowed. However, the cameras can be used to save pictures at each step (a function of the API is available for this), you can then use these pictures to generates a video.

##### black\_hammer\_67 06/11/2020 09:18:51
yes


i checked the cv2.\_\_version\_\_ too


its 4.2


all work perfectly outside webots

##### Stefania Pedrazzi [cyberbotics] 06/11/2020 09:19:46
did you install webots using the snap?

yes straight from the ubuntu software

##### Stefania Pedrazzi [cyberbotics] 06/11/2020 09:21:50
ok, so then Webots is running on the snap sandbox and the openCV you installed on the system is not available in the sandbox.


You have two options:

1) reinstall Webots from the debian or tarball package ([https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots/releases](https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots/releases))


2) run your controller external from the snap sandbox (see [https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/installation-procedure#extern-controllers](https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/installation-procedure#extern-controllers)) and use the snap installation

##### black\_hammer\_67 06/11/2020 09:24:32
i guess that i'll have similar problems later with tensorflow


so i think the best is to reinstall it

##### Stefania Pedrazzi [cyberbotics] 06/11/2020 09:27:30
Yes, there will be the same issues. Using external controllers works even with tensorflow.

The difference between the two options is that with external controllers you have to start the controllers manually from a terminal, but yes having them starting automatically from Webots (i.e. using a different installation method than snap) is easier.

`@David Mansolino` Hello, you had answered my question previously regarding this. But I still have some doubts. I am sorry I am reading the documentation and sample codes simultaneously.

I understand that in the wbt file I can specify the robot/ vehicle and give it name for example

DEF EGO\_VEHICLE TeslaModel3 {

  translation 6.38 0.4 174.59

  rotation 0 1 0 1.60078733165

  name "agent\_0"

  controller "ros\_automobile"

  controllerArgs "--name=agent\_0 --clock --use-sim-time"

  sensorsSlotCenter [

    GPS {

    }

  ]

}

In this section of wbt file I have specified Tesla vehicle's name as ego vehicle

And using supervisor I can reference it 

robot\_node = supervisor.getFromDef("EGO\_VEHICLE")

trans\_field = robot\_node.getField("translation")

##### Marian 06/11/2020 10:01:35
`@David Mansolino` It works as long as I don't try to load that world again.

The question is how to create EGO\_VEHICLE from the code


meaning I dont want to specify that there is a vehicle in simulation using wbt file


but to create it based on some predefined conditions


in that case will I require to generate a proto


i mean should i create a proto


and name is EGO\_VEHICLE and try to reference in via getfromDef

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 06/11/2020 10:07:30
`@dimple.bhuta` do you want to generate the proto from your own code?

##### dimple.bhuta 06/11/2020 10:07:30
and than generate cars like EGO\_VEHICLE1, EGO\_VEHICLE2 etc

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 06/11/2020 10:07:57
or use existing protos, and just spawn them in with your code, changing the DEF?

##### dimple.bhuta 06/11/2020 10:08:06
`@Simon Steinmann` I want to generate the vehicle from the code not sure about the proto


yes it will be better to use tesla model proto and spawn them


but i am still not understanding how exactly to do it


as i did try


robot\_node = supervisor.getFromDef("TeslaModel3") accessing the tesla model this way but its definitely wrong

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 06/11/2020 10:09:51
does it have to be spawned dynamically, while running the simulation, or just once at the start?

##### dimple.bhuta 06/11/2020 10:10:08
no it has to be dynamic


and there should be multiple cars spawing at different times

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 06/11/2020 10:10:34
> robot\_node = supervisor.getFromDef("TeslaModel3") accessing the tesla model this way but its definitely wrong

`@dimple.bhuta` this works right? you just need to know how to spawn a new tesla and assign it a DEF

##### dimple.bhuta 06/11/2020 10:10:37
thats why i cant specify it in  wbt file


No actually it didn't work. Also how can I assign it a def i mean a name to it

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 06/11/2020 10:11:44
I do it using the GUI

##### dimple.bhuta 06/11/2020 10:12:02
okay

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 06/11/2020 10:12:03
you click on the node and should see a DEF variable you can specify

##### dimple.bhuta 06/11/2020 10:12:16
so isnt it possible via code?

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 06/11/2020 10:17:04
let me have a look, rebooted to linux

##### dimple.bhuta 06/11/2020 10:17:57
Also by specifying the vehicle name (specifying the tesla proto in wbt file and giving it "EGO\_VEHICLE" name) i can access the following classes

robot\_node = supervisor.getFromDef("EGO\_VEHICLE")

print (dir(robot\_node))



[ego\_vehicle] ['ACCELEROMETER', 'APPEARANCE', 'BACKGROUND', 'BALL\_JOINT', 'BALL\_JOINT\_PARAMETERS', 'BOX', 'BRAKE', 'CAMERA', 'CAPSULE', 'CHARGER', 'COLOR', 'COMPASS', 'CONE', 'CONNECTOR''setVelocity', 'setVisibility', 'this']

I mean there are more but due to space constraint

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 06/11/2020 10:18:53
you can access anything within that node

##### dimple.bhuta 06/11/2020 10:20:03
However if I do the same with tesla proto

robot\_node = supervisor.getFromDef("TeslaModel3")

print (dir(robot\_node))

following are the functions [ego\_vehicle] ['\_\_class\_\_', '\_\_delattr\_\_', '\_\_doc\_\_', '\_\_format\_\_', '\_\_getattribute\_\_', '\_\_hash\_\_', '\_\_init\_\_', '\_\_new\_\_', '\_\_reduce\_\_', '\_\_reduce\_ex\_\_', '\_\_repr\_\_', '\_\_setattr\_\_', '\_\_sizeof\_\_', '\_\_str\_\_', '\_\_subclasshook\_\_']

so I cant actually access the vehicle. hence I thought it was wrong way of accessing


`@Simon Steinmann` Thanks a lot. I will also simultaneously go through all your examples and see if I can figure it out. I was able to use your sumo\_supervisor example to add/delete vehicles on the go


but there is an issue using ros\_automobile controller


but thank you for all your help

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 06/11/2020 10:21:23
it depends on the structure of your node. you might have to do something like: 

robot\_node.motor.get\_position()

##### dimple.bhuta 06/11/2020 10:27:46
I went through this /usr/local/webots/projects/default/controllers/sumo\_supervisor


and its corresponding proto and modified my code accordingly


you have an objects.py function


where code is written to generate vehicles based on departure time

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 06/11/2020 10:29:07
I see it, having a look

##### dimple.bhuta 06/11/2020 10:29:12

you should be able to adress or call the different vehicles by using

`@David Mansolino` I managed to do it. But I have a few questions:

what do these arguments do exactly? is there a documentation?

[--output=outputFile] [--box-collision] [--normal] [--disable-mesh-optimization]



- the generated proto is a robot node, while the 3f gripper included in webots is a solid node. Is this important?



- the gripper points sideways when attaching it to the endeffector of a robot arm, as the ros model goes along z axis, not y axis. How do I change this?

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 06/11/2020 12:39:22
You can use the '--help' argument to get more information about these arguments.


About the Robot, it might indeed be better to just transform it into a Solid node, but it all depends on what you want to do.


About the orientation, you might simply use the 'rotation' field to rotate it.

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 06/11/2020 12:40:44
oh okay


would you recommend not disabling the mesh-optimization?


I want a proper end model, dont care about the speed

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 06/11/2020 12:41:56

to change it into a Solid, do I just replace Robot with Solid ontop of the proto file and remove the controller?

##### Stefania Pedrazzi [cyberbotics] 06/11/2020 13:49:35
`@Lussfer`  yes, you can use the `wb_display_fill_rectangle` function to clear the display using for example a black color. I'm searching for an example..

`@Lussfer` yes it works as `@Stefania Pedrazzi` said. For example, I do it like follow :

disp\_stab.fillRectangle(0, 0, param.DISPLAY\_SIZE,param.DISPLAY\_SIZE)

`@Simon Steinmann` not yet, but that's on our short term plans: [https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots/issues/1365](https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots/issues/1365)

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 06/11/2020 14:29:29
hmm how would I go about implementing this now? The robotiq 2f gripper has basically 1 motor, and mimics all joints

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 06/11/2020 14:30:12
For now the workaround is to actually put 2 motors and send exactly the same command to both in the controller

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 06/11/2020 14:30:12
is there a way to do this in the model, or do I have to do it with the controller and move 'motors' that dont really exist

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 06/11/2020 14:30:29
For now only in the controller.

##### Stefania Pedrazzi [cyberbotics] 06/11/2020 15:10:04
Yes, you can connect multiple joints to the same Solid part using the `SolidReference` node ([https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/solidreference](https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/solidreference)). This is used for example in the Khepera3 gripper : [https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/khepera3#khepera3\_gripper-wbt](https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/khepera3#khepera3_gripper-wbt)

quick question: the setAvailableTorque function can be used to control how hard / soft the gripper grips right?


if I set it to .5 of max torque, it will only grip an object half as tight

If I were to just replace the gripping portion, and leave the rest of the high poly mesh, would that have a significant performance impact?


or does only the contact surface really matter?

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 06/12/2020 09:59:12
The most important is the contact, the other part are also important but much less

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 06/12/2020 10:00:36
what is the best course of action here? replace all the geometry entries from the high poly model with the one from the low poly?

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 06/12/2020 10:01:42
Actually instead of low poly meshes it is even better to replace them with basic geometries for the bounding objects (i.e. use a set of boxes, spheres, cylinder, etc.)

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 06/12/2020 10:03:19
just the bounding object, or the geometry too?

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 06/12/2020 10:03:41
Just the boundign object should be enough (at least for improving the physics behavior)

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 06/12/2020 10:03:58
that would leave the nice look?

Yes

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 06/12/2020 10:05:35
is there a way, other than converting to base nodes, to find the correct object in the proto file?

Hi, I am using nightly build (10.6.2020) in linux. After simulation reset, I cant take new images from op2 camera.


What is problem?

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 06/12/2020 10:54:22
`@gcarboni1`: using a simple Sphere, possibly with a low friction, should work. The sphere won't rotate in Webots, but you probably don't care. If you want it to rotate, you could implement it using a passive BallJoint node.


[https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/balljoint](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/balljoint)


`@chenpixx`: no idea. Is this problem specific to this nightly build or can you observe it also with other versions?

Hello,


I am using a scene containing a lot of textures for AprilTags/QRCode (500 different texture).


Each texture is applied to a solid representing the april tag.


I noticed that using small images impact the simulation speed.


Bigger images make it twice as fast (which is pretty cool for my use case). I am just wondering why ? Because it could help me optimising the other textures I'm using, and make the simulation even faster maybe.

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 06/12/2020 15:38:56
Do you mean the resolution of the texture or the size of the texture on the object?

##### ClBaze 06/12/2020 15:39:07
the resolution

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 06/12/2020 15:40:04
It could be that small texture size are filtered whereas larges textures are not and this filtering takes time?

##### ClBaze 06/12/2020 15:40:15
with 512x512 images the simulation runs at 0.3x the real time, while 1024x1024 runs 0.5x

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 06/12/2020 15:40:37
Did you try to play with the `TextureImage.filtering` parameter?

##### ClBaze 06/12/2020 15:40:51
no

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 06/12/2020 15:41:42

##### ClBaze 06/12/2020 15:42:36
Filtering is set to 4 is my case. I'm using a gtx 1050Ti

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 06/12/2020 15:43:13
OK... Honestly I have no idea why you are getting a better performance with high resolution textures.... It seems odd...

##### ClBaze 06/12/2020 15:43:45

even the physics seems faster

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 06/12/2020 15:45:59
I see. Do you use any special sensor in this simulation?


If you disable any robot (use a void controller) do you get the same?

##### ClBaze 06/12/2020 15:47:38
Yes, I have two cameras with a default ros controller, but they weren't enabled during the bench

`@Olivier Michel` Is there a difference between setting controller to "" and "void" ?

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 06/12/2020 15:55:46
Yes. Setting to "" will not launch any process (and is lighter). Setting it to void will launch the void controller which basically does nothing but runs in the background.

Wow. If I set every controller to "void" it runs 2.8x with 512x512 and 0.28x with 1024x1024

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 06/12/2020 16:16:25
Interesting... So can you try to remove the cameras from your robot to see whether this is the cause of the slow down?

##### ClBaze 06/12/2020 16:20:37
Ok maybe the 2.8x was because the images weren't finished being copied on the filesystem when I launched the bench for 512x512


I've run it twice, just to be sure, it was running at 0.5x this time


I'm removing the cameras now

I am participating in a project where we have a robot-vehicle in Webots. The robots gets its instructions from an ADA program via TCP. The communication works fine and we got the robot rolling. However, our simulation freezes pretty often. This behavior is non-deterministic: Sometimes it happens after just a few seconds, sometimes after a minute. The simulation speed goes to 0 and it does not proceed (not even a single simulation step). What could cause the freezes? We are using the latest stable Windows version.


When the simulation freezes, our ADA program can still recieve and send data to our Simulation's internal C-Controller.

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 06/12/2020 17:41:30
`@Zerfallskonstante` do you use an internal or external controller for webots?

##### Zerfallskonstante 06/12/2020 17:46:21
I am not quite sure what you consider an internal or external controller. we wrote a small controller in C which executes in webots. This controller sends the raw sensor data to the external Ada program. The ada program sends the motor data to the c controller. i hope, this description is helpful.

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 06/12/2020 17:46:48
if it runs in webots, it's not external


how do you synchornize time?


is the webots controller broadcasting the sim time?

##### Zerfallskonstante 06/12/2020 17:48:22
no, the time is not synchronized between the internal controller and the ada program

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 06/12/2020 17:49:14
hmm hard to say, I'm a python and ROS guy. sorry


the simulation only continues, when your main loop in the controller keeps running and calls the robot step function. Perhaps another part in your loop gets stuck. Perhaps something with the sensors

##### Zerfallskonstante 06/12/2020 17:52:39
Thank you! Even though I didnt write the C controller, i will try to look for non-terminating loops in the internal controller.

##### dimple.bhuta 06/13/2020 09:48:57
Thank you `@Simon Steinmann` and `@David Mansolino` I am able to generate and spawn the vehicles given i have the starting id information. Following is the code for the same. Just incase it is useful for someone


from controller import Supervisor

self.rootChildren = self.supervisor.getRoot().getField("children")

defName = "EGO\_VEHICLE%d" % i

            vehicleString = "DEF " + defName + " " + "TeslaModel3" + " {\n"

            vehicleString += "  translation 10000 0.5 0\n"

            vehicleString += "  name \"{}\"\n".format(self.robot\_ids[i])

            vehicleString += "  sensorsSlotCenter [\n"

            vehicleString += "    GPS {\n"

            vehicleString += "    }\n"

            vehicleString += "  ]\n"

            vehicleString += "  }\n"

            self.rootChildren.importMFNodeFromString(-1, vehicleString)

            robot\_node = self.supervisor.getFromDef(defName)


i guess i am not able to paste the whole code


following snippets helped me generate the vehicle


robot\_node = self.supervisor.getFromDef(defName)


controller\_field=robot\_node.getField("controller")

 controller\_field.setSFString("ros\_automobile")


and using the above I can assign controller and starting translation and rotation position. Once again thank you for your help.

You may want to try to use gdb to debug your controller: [https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/debugging-c-cpp-controllers](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/debugging-c-cpp-controllers)

##### G1020BS 06/14/2020 11:07:47

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 06/14/2020 11:08:16
Yes, in that case, you should the the Visual Studio debugger instead.

##### G1020BS 06/14/2020 11:10:47
Its giving me a lot of errors. Like, it cannot open source files like webots/Robot.hpp and such.

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 06/14/2020 11:12:11
You should probably setup some path somewhere so that these files are found...

``` Any ideas?

##### elidor00 06/14/2020 15:41:19
Goodmorning everyone,

i am using webots for a university project. I have a problem in my controller for the pioneer3dx robot with the rangeImageGetDepth method on a RangeFinder object.

The code is as follows:



`kinectrange = robot.getRangeFinder("kinect range")

kinectrange.enable(TIME\_STEP)

\# robot.step(timestep)

image = kinectrange.getRangeImage()

while robot.step(TIME\_STEP) != -1:

    kinect\_values = kinectrange.getRangeImage()

    for i in range(75):

        value = RangeFinder.rangeImageGetDepth(kinect\_values, 150, i, 60)`


And during the execution, I received the message 



"Process finished with exit code 139 (interrupted by signal 11: SIGSEGV)"


I'm using python3.8 and webotsR2020a revision 1

`@sanyaade` hi, welcome to the group!


> Goodmorning everyone,

`@elidor00` there is a problem in your code this:

```Python
value = RangeFinder.rangeImageGetDepth(kinect_values, 150, i, 60)
```

Should be replaced by:

```Python
value = kinectrange.rangeImageGetDepth(kinect_values, 150, i, 60)
```

But even with this fix it seems indeed that it is crashing


The following seems however to works fine:

```Python
value = kinect_values[kinectrange.getWidth() * 60 + i]
```


I can't unforunately find the reason of the original crash, we will investigate this, in any case you should probably extract the value directly from the array as I showed just before.

##### nelsondmmg 06/15/2020 06:48:50
Hi, I a question concerning the vehicle control done with throttle/brake. First, using a 3DoF dynamic model I can model rather nicely the acceleration of the vehicle, but the breaking still presents some errors, as one can see at the end of the figure (x is time in ms and y is velocity). The blue line is the executed by webots and the red in the one predicted. I'm using a Tesla Model3, so the braking force calculated was F= max(2 * brakeCoefficient * wTire + 4 * wheelsDampingConstant * wTire, mu * g * m/2), with the mu being defined in WorldInfo. I even tried to modify the brake value in the node of the vehicle, but the behavior remain the same. It seems to me that maybe there is some dynamic friction involved, with is lower than mu, and when the velocity becomes close to 0, the static is used, resulting in a sharp velocity fall to 0. Is there a dynamic mu defined somewhere? I didn't find anything in the ODE documentation.

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 06/15/2020 07:07:19
Hi `@nelsondmmg`, we did some calibration of the brake with some other electrical vehicles (e.g. C-Zero) and the brake was following the blue curve.

But to have something closer to the red curve, can you try to replacing this line:

[https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots/blob/master/projects/default/libraries/vehicle/c/driver/src/driver.c#L362](https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots/blob/master/projects/default/libraries/vehicle/c/driver/src/driver.c#L362)

By:

```c
const double damping_constant = fabs(instance->brake * instance->car->brake_coefficient)
```

And the recompiling the driver library.

##### nelsondmmg 06/15/2020 07:08:31
Ok, I'm going to try it. Thanks!


I'm trying to compile the code and the following message appears:

Using apt

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 06/15/2020 08:03:08
Note also that you should not need to install the complete development environment to recompile the driver library, you should be able to reompile the one from your installed version of Webots.


> Using apt

`@nelsondmmg` Ok then this is the problem, glm come with the clone of Webots as a submodule, the clone should be done with the `--recurse-submodules` argument.

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 06/15/2020 08:08:21
`@G1020BS`: no idea about this crash... Can you compile one of the provided controller examples with Visual Studio and see whether it crashes too? If it does, that means there is likely a bug with the libController and you should open a bug report. Otherwise, that probably means that your controller has a problem and causes the crash. In such a case, I would recommend you to try to debug your controller by removing lines of code until it doesn't crash any more.

Is it possible to make such simulation in which we can study the aerodynamic behaviour of drone.

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 06/15/2020 08:49:11
Hi. Yes, this is possible, but in that case, you should probably apply forces and torques directly from a supervisor controller instead of using a Propeller device. See [https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/supervisor#wb\_supervisor\_node\_add\_force](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/supervisor#wb_supervisor_node_add_force)

Hello, is it possible to model a spring in Webots, in a way that it can change shape when it is being compressed or extended; and also, act like a spring in terms of mechanics?

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 06/15/2020 13:13:06
The Slider Joint can indeed act as a spring, see this chapter abotu the spring and damper effect of joints: [https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/jointparameters#springs-and-dampers](https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/jointparameters#springs-and-dampers)


About the deformation, you might use a skin node that will make the shape to be deformed when the joint moves.

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 06/16/2020 05:07:30
Hi `@Luiz Felipe` which simulation are you running? Is your controller using Qt?

##### Luiz Felipe 06/16/2020 10:07:02
In my personal environment the error does not happen, but when my colleague is running in his environment this error happened. He reinstalled Webots (removing all files related to webots) and the error still happens.


I don't think it is using Qt directly. The environment is a variant of this repo: [https://github.com/omichel/test\_world](https://github.com/omichel/test_world)

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 06/16/2020 10:14:28
That seems to indicate that the supervisor is linked against Qt...

##### Luiz Felipe 06/16/2020 10:26:51
is it not finding the qt library?

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 06/16/2020 10:27:54
Yes, but it is strange as the supervisor should not try to find the Qt library. It has no dependency on it...

##### Luiz Felipe 06/16/2020 10:28:36
Yes, i never experienced that running the environment hundreds of times...

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 06/16/2020 10:30:27
It could be the supervisor is launching another process which on your colleague's machine is different from yours and requires Qt...

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 06/16/2020 12:41:09
That's still a beta so it is indeed not as stable as the latest release :-(

Would it be possible for you to report this bug too (and ideally include a PROTO that reproduces the issue with the report), so that we can make sure it will fix this in the beta?

##### Master6 06/16/2020 12:47:20

I couldn't find any documentation about skin node to model a spring. Can you suggest if there is any?

##### sanyaade 06/16/2020 18:16:05
Today I used webots in my computing class to teach programming in Python. Students simulate e-pluck using adapted webots Tutorials.

Everything went well but there are couple of hiccups:

    1.) Python 3.7 is requirement so < 3.7 or >= 3.8 will not work

    2.) Python has to be download, installed as system wide in Windows. This creates some issues but most student were able to resolved this.

    3.) I will like to used webots at lower age 6-16 old kids, to teach introduction to Programming (Python) and Robotics (ESP8266/ESP-32 based Robots)



In order to create solution for all the above points, I was wondering may I should compile Webots, packaged with its own Python compiler in order to make portable and non operating systems dependent. Look getting to work with a range of Python compilers versions e.g. > 2.7 or >3.7 as opposed to a fixed version only. (SWIG or SWIG alternative FFI generator(s) ). 



Is it possible to replace QT dependent with [https://github.com/Immediate-Mode-UI/Nuklear](https://github.com/Immediate-Mode-UI/Nuklear) ?  Later to see if I could get my hands dirty to do this as a project



Many thanks for creating and releasing now as open source. 



God blesses!!!

`@sinancimen` the skin node is unfortunately not yet documented. However, some examples are availables: [https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/samples-rendering#animated\_skin-wbt](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/samples-rendering#animated_skin-wbt)


`@sanyaade`, I suppose you are on Windows right?

About Qt, it should indeed be possible, but since Webots dependencies on Qt is not negligible, this would be a huge amount of work, and I am not sure to understand what would be the advantage?

##### nelsondmmg 06/17/2020 07:29:02
The vertical inertia moment of the vehicle in this case is the I22? Inside the PROTO file, according to the documentation the first line is I11, I22, I33; considering the color system used in the global coordinates the vertical axis would be y?

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 06/17/2020 07:52:29
Yes, this is correct. By the way, we are going to introduce the possibility to switch to Z for the vertical axis in an upcoming version of Webots.

##### nelsondmmg 06/17/2020 07:53:47
Ok, thanks. That would be more intuitive, I used I33 as the vertical inertia for a long time üòÖ

Hi I had a question regarding wbt file. For representation purposes will it be possible to plot points on lanes of a road.

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 06/17/2020 09:14:01
Do you mean like using a Pen device to write on the road?

##### dimple.bhuta 06/17/2020 09:16:02
for an edge I have a set of points like a reference path. I wanted to check if its possible to plot the reference path (no in real time) on the lanes

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 06/17/2020 09:17:17
Can't you simply modify the road texture files?

##### dimple.bhuta 06/17/2020 09:17:24
i went through the documentation for road proto but it doesn't seem to facilitate plotting of reference paths on top of road proto

Hello, I would like to know how to randomize robots and objects' positions when resetting the simulation.

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 06/17/2020 10:45:14
You have to move them at a random position from the supervisor at the first step after the reset.

##### PurplePi 06/17/2020 10:56:58
Ok, thank you. I was wondering if this was possible to have a random function inside the world file ?

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 06/17/2020 10:57:32
Not in the world file, but in the PROTO file yes, you can use procedural PROTO: [https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/procedural-proto-nodes](https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/procedural-proto-nodes)

##### wessel 06/17/2020 12:06:09
Hello, I am working on a robotic arm, but when i added everything it just falls down and swings around


whilst there is a rotary motor connected


how do i fix this?

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 06/17/2020 12:08:28
You should attach it to the static environment. In order to do so, the first link of the robot should have the `NULL` value in its physics field.

##### wessel 06/17/2020 12:09:43
What should i set to null? what do you mean with the first link of the robot?


it says Damping Null

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 06/17/2020 12:10:07
What arm are you using?

##### wessel 06/17/2020 12:10:18
my own

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 06/17/2020 12:11:09
I mean the Robot node (which is the first link, the second link being connected to the first one with a HingeJoint and a RotationalMotor).

##### wessel 06/17/2020 12:11:47
alright so i currently have only damping saying Null

it does pivot correctly


the way i want it to go


before when i added a rotary motor the part just stopped swinging


now it swings even with rotary motor


but the bottom wheel spins fine and works with rotary motor

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 06/17/2020 12:15:16
So, it looks like it is mobile robot, not a fixed arm?

##### wessel 06/17/2020 12:15:27
yes

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 06/17/2020 12:15:54
In that case, forget about my advice to set the physics to NULL, it's correct the way you did.


Unfortunately, I have no idea why your arm is swinging...

i looked at those


still confused

Ok so can you be a bit more precise, what is confusing you?

##### Davie 06/17/2020 14:02:39
well for starters, that first link says nothing about LEDs

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 06/17/2020 14:04:54
Yes, but it explains how to retrieve device handles with the Python API (which works the same for all the Devices).

##### Davie 06/17/2020 14:05:31
thisis just for aschool assignmenti dont understand any of that


and i dont have time to understandit

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 06/17/2020 14:09:08
Then I'd suggest asking your teacher

##### Davie 06/17/2020 14:09:15
he isnt available


hence why im here


can i just get some very high-level instructions here? i just want some leds to blink on the epuck

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 06/17/2020 14:12:18
the LEDs are called "led0" and "led1"

##### Davie 06/17/2020 14:12:25
ye

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 06/17/2020 14:15:25
so get a device handle to the LEDs, I havent tested it, but this should work:

LED0 = robot.getLED('led0')


then you can control the LED using the functions as explained in the documentation (2nd link he sent)

##### Davie 06/17/2020 14:23:25
i put this in the controller and now the epuck wont move



class LED (Device):

   def get(self):

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 06/17/2020 14:28:32

I purposefully pasted it as an image. type it yourself and try to understand. if something is not clear, let me know. A good little exercise would be to change the color of one of the LEDs


as an explanation of the ledValue. I use the simulation time and the sinusfunction to get an oscilating value. So the core is sin(2*pi*time). we need to add the 2*pi, because we want to oscilate once per second, not once per ~6,3 seconds. By multiplying our frequency in hz, we can increase or decrease the frequency. (sin(...)+1)/2 makes it so we oscilate between 0 and 1 and not -1 and 1


then we round(sin(...), 0) so we get 0 or 1 and finally we turn it into and integer using int()

##### Zenzo 06/17/2020 15:18:18
`@Simon Steinmann` I was looking at this conversation and it made me curious as to how you make blinking LED lights with maths, could you explain it a little further? I am very simple so simplifying it will help me to understand thanks.

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 06/17/2020 15:27:21
`@Zenzo` 

`#!/usr/bin/env python2

\# -*- coding: utf-8 -*-

from math import sin, pi

import time



start\_time=  time.time()

while True:

    t = time.time() - start\_time   #time in seconds going up from 0

    

    value1 = sin(t) # oscilates between -1 and 1

    value2 = sin(t)+1 # oscilates between 0 and 2

    value3 = (sin(t)+1)/2 # oscilates between 0 and 1

    value4 = round(value3,0) # JUMPS between -0 and 1

    value5 = int(value4) # turns value4 into integer

    

    print(value1, value2, value3, value4, value5`)


let me know if this is clear üôÇ


keep in mind that you have to use sin(2 * pi * t) if you want the value to oscilate ONCE per second, instead of 2*pi seconds (about 6,3 seconds)


you can also do sin(2 * pi * frequency * t)  with frequency being a variable you set. This is the value in Hz, so with frequency = 10, the value oscilates 10 times a second


Can you follow, or do you want me to elaborate?

Looking through the ODE documentation, each surface has a mu, the static friction constant and a rho, the dynamic friction constant. I cannot find the rho definition in the contact properties node. What happens if I apply a torque in a tire with a higher intensity than the longitudinal static friction? Right now I am putting a high value for mu to avoid this scenario, but I noticed that when mu is low the velocity keeps oscillating. In the picture I used by control to set the throttle, but with a constant throttle value the plot is similar.

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 06/17/2020 16:02:19
`@Olivier Michel` Can I address a field of a node directly? or do I have to use the "getField()" function first to get a handle? I'm trying to change the gradual and color field of a LED node. How would I go about that? Oh and what in the heck is the datatype of the color Field? in the documentation it's "color: [1 1 1]" but that's no data type. Slightly confusing

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 06/17/2020 16:03:46
You should use `getField()`.


And the data type you receive in Python should be an array of 3 floats.

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 06/17/2020 16:05:19
can I also set it that way? as an array=

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 06/17/2020 16:05:54
Yes, using the setter.

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 06/17/2020 16:06:05
thx, I'll try


LED0 = robot.getLED('led0')

gradual = LED0.getField('gradual')



2nd line throws errer


AttributeError: type object 'object' has no attribute '\_\_getattr\_\_'

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 06/17/2020 16:10:58
You should use getFromDEF() instead of getLED().

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 06/17/2020 16:11:49
oh wait, the robot has to be supervisor right?


otherwise I cant use that functionality

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 06/17/2020 16:12:38
Yes.

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 06/17/2020 16:13:05
uff, okay, the LED node really needs direct functionality to set gradual and color. This is quite painful workflow :p

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 06/17/2020 16:16:22
If you want to change the color of a LED, you should use the LED API instead.


I am not sure what you are trying to do...


Can't you simply use the LED.set() method?

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 06/17/2020 16:17:27
for that, the gradual field has to be set to true, and the color  field needs to be empty

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 06/17/2020 16:17:55
Yes, but why don't you set this in the world or proto file?

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 06/17/2020 16:17:57
would be nice to do that in the controller, not the proto file

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 06/17/2020 16:18:28
So, the only way is to use a supervisor then.

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 06/17/2020 16:22:46

this is the proto for the LED

and I get the node handle like this:

with robot being a Supervisor()

`@Simon Steinmann` `getFromDef` can't get node inside a PROTO, this is why you get None. If you are using a beta of Webots R2020b you can use instead the `getFromProtoDef` function ([https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/supervisor?version=develop&tab-language=python#wb\_supervisor\_node\_get\_from\_proto\_def](https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/supervisor?version=develop&tab-language=python#wb_supervisor_node_get_from_proto_def)) that allows to get node inside a PROTO (in read only mode).

##### nelsondmmg 06/18/2020 06:56:07
Thanks for the answer, but how the tire reacts when the static force is higher than the friction when the rho is zero and the fds is also zero? That's what I don't understand in ODE documentation.

From the manual it is said that only `mu` should always be set. My guess is that mu will impact the dynamic case when rho and fds are 0.

##### lojik 06/18/2020 07:19:35
As I understood by reading doc a bit with mu and fds is when the force at contact point is bigger than friction, the contact point will move with a constant speed equal to fds * normal force.



But I did not have the expected behavior in simulation on my side too.

##### Shadow 06/18/2020 08:39:23
I'm having issues with object recognition. The robot can detect the objects correctly but if the robot is on the other side of a wall it can detect the object through it. The detectable object is just a flat plane placed on the wall but if I move it away from the wall a bit, the robot can no longer detect it from the other side. Do you have any thoughts on how I could fix this? Thanks.

`@lojik` I'm gonna try to find out how the connection is modeled.

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 06/18/2020 08:50:01
`@Shadow`, did you set the `occlusion` of the Recognition node to True?

##### Shadow 06/18/2020 08:53:21
Yes it is

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 06/18/2020 08:54:06
Ok, in that case does your wall have a bounding object?

##### Shadow 06/18/2020 08:57:50
Yes it does

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 06/18/2020 08:58:36
Ok, then you have to make sure that the object is completely 'hidden' by the bounding object from the camera

##### lojik 06/18/2020 09:12:31
`@nelsondmmg` thank you üëå Right now my simulation begin to slide down the slope as soon as it is a little bit tilted (0.5 degrees for example).



I do not think that the friction coulomb is taken into account here ...



For your understanding : Friction coulomb is 1, firce dependent slip is 0.001, basic time step is 2



I would help more but I am at the end of my master thesis and friction is not my higgest priority now in this simulation üòÖ

Hi `@chungshan` it seems you have a version of Qt that is installed on your Docker that is not compatible with cv2.

Which version of Webots are you using?

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 06/19/2020 05:35:11
Hi! Can you try running your opencv controller as an extern controller as explained here: [https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/running-extern-robot-controllers?tab-os=linux](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/running-extern-robot-controllers?tab-os=linux). If that still doesn't work, I would recommend you to change the LD\_LIBRARY\_PATH variable so that it points to a new folder that you will create and that will contain a copy of libController.so and libCppController.so. The goal here is to avoid that your controller uses the Qt libraries of Webots.

##### chungshan 06/19/2020 05:37:41

##### G1020BS 06/19/2020 11:56:52
`@Olivier Michel` I made a robot with tracks like your example world ‚Äòtrack‚Äô. The only thing is, when I start to turn, the robot only goes back and forward like an idiot. Any suggestions?

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 06/19/2020 12:04:51
The track.wbt example is working fine with respect to turning. How does your example differ from this one?

##### G1020BS 06/19/2020 12:10:42
I also made a tank and gave it tracks. But when I let it turn, it just goes back and forward.


If I set the controller to go just forward or backward, everything is fine. But turning just doesn't work

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 06/19/2020 12:21:18
How to you program turning? Set a positive speed on one track and the same, but negative speed on the other track?

##### G1020BS 06/19/2020 12:39:41
Thats correct


leftSpeed = 0.1 and rightSpeed = -0.1

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 06/19/2020 16:21:06
Please try to see how you example differ from the provided `track.wbt` example which works for turning. This will allow you to understand why your robot is not turning as expected. And keep us posted about your findings.

##### novice\_2222 06/19/2020 19:34:51
Hey!

I'm new to Webots and I'm trying to implement inverse kinematics algorithms for robotic manipulators (arms).

I'm currently using the UR10e manipulator.

I already implemented the algorithms in Python and in them I described the kinematics via rotation matrices which I derived from parametrizing the robot structure with Denavit-Hartenberg parameters.

I have also used Matplotlib animations to verify that the algorithms work.

The problem I have is the following:

I'm not able to align the coordinate systems used in my algorithms to those in the simulator.

I thought I just have to align the global coordinate system to the robot's base and check that the initial motor angles (positions) coincide, however I simply can't get it right.

Since I'm not too familiar with how the arm is implemented in Webots, I used measurements provided

by Universal robotics (manufacturers of UR10e) to get the link lenghts and of the arm and I simulated the arm

with motor positions set to 0 for the default angles. I derived the DH parameters from this.

I also added the GPS device in the tool slot to get the end-effector position and orientation.

However, I feel like I have the wrong approach. Is there a better way to do this?

The end goal is to be able to verify that the way I reprezent the robot in the algorithms 

is the same as in the simulation so that I can then calculate the Jacobian and so on.

I converted the UR10e PROTO node into the Robot class, but I don't know to extract the relevant data from there,

like axis of rotation as provided in the HingeJointParameters.

If you can point me to relevant documentation, a sample with direct kinematics on manipulators or explain what

should I do, it would help a lot, thanks.

##### chenpixx 06/19/2020 20:58:14
I think that the final nighly build (19.06) is for windows not linux. Is it correct? When will you publish for linuz?

Hi, guys.

i have a question and need you help, now i create  a robot and a independent camera device (within the robot), i use a supervisor controller in the robot so that i can control the  independent camera, and i can get node by using the API getFromDef, but i can't control the camera (i think i should using API like getCamera,but i can't find in supervisor  class), so how to control camera (enable, get image and so on ) by using supervisor controller? by the way, the language i use is python .  Thanks!

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 06/21/2020 07:28:37
The Supervisor object inherits from the Robot object, so you should be able to use any Robot API function from your Supervisor object.

`@David Mansolino` 

i can't see it in the Generic-robot-window , the robot doesn't contain  the 'cameras', which is a external camera, so i want to using supervisor controller to get the camera, but i don't know how to do.

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 06/22/2020 08:30:43
so you mean that the camera does not belong to the robot from which you want to access it?

##### bug 06/22/2020 08:30:58
yes

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 06/22/2020 08:31:46
In that case I am sorry, but the devices are only accessible for the robot whose they belong. But if you want you can use the emitter/receiver API to share the images of the camera between controllers.

Can you please send your world file to support@cyberbotics.com so that we can check it?

##### G1020BS 06/22/2020 12:41:24
Sure.


I've sent an email

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 06/22/2020 12:44:00
Got it!


OK, I am getting many warnings when loading it (missing proto files, images, etc.) but it shows up and seems fine. I am testing it with an older R2020a revision 2. I will test the last nightly now...

##### G1020BS 06/22/2020 12:49:18
Okay. So if 2020b doesn't work I'll downgrade to r2020a rev2. Do you want me to send the proto files and such or is that no necessary?

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 06/22/2020 12:50:29
I thought you were already using R2020a revision 2 as I told you...

##### G1020BS 06/22/2020 12:51:02
The exe on that page is a 2020b


I see. Both a 2020a and 2020b are on that page


I installed 2020a rev2 and I can open the world also. When I save the camera image as a jpeg I still get a distorted image

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 06/22/2020 13:02:49
OK, let me check again.


OK, I confirm I can run the example in `WEBOTS_HOME/samples/devices/worlds/camera.wbt` and it works as expected when I change the image type from PNG to JPG (and recompile the controller). The resulting JPG images are well saved (and look correct) in my home folder `C:\Users\username\blue_blob.jpg`


So, I would suspect that in your case, a conflicting JPEG library is found in your PATH and causes problems with JPEG save.


Can you check if you have some libjpeg-8.dll in your PATH that might conflict with the one shipped with Webots?

##### G1020BS 06/22/2020 13:14:55
Will do


I scanned my drive for it and it only found Openshot Video Editor using it. It didn't appear to be in my path though.. When I removed it nothing changes. Is it a possibility, when I reinstalled webots with the nightly built, that some files were kept and not reinstalled? Or does the install erase all the files first?


It appears theres nothing in my PATH that uses that .dll

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 06/22/2020 13:37:19
If files are remaining after the uninstall, they should be removed manually. However, this should not happen normally...

##### G1020BS 06/22/2020 13:37:46
I'll try to reinstall once more


Did a complete uninstall of Webots and installed 2020a rev 2 again. Still no change..

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 06/22/2020 13:49:41
Do you get the same problem with the `camera.wbt` example world I just mentioned?

##### G1020BS 06/22/2020 13:55:46

If i click Run nothing happens, in the output terminal prompts "Warning: matlab: MATLAB Controllers should be launched as extern controllers with the snap package of webots"


matlab is callable from the terminal so the bin-dir is linked properly


also the sample world "Robots/Nao" with Matlab-Controller behaves the same with the Warning..

It looks like you are missing the textures. Are they available through the corresponding URL?

##### Jiajun Wang 06/23/2020 08:16:56
`@David Mansolino`  the example is not so clearly. 

So, can it be understood this way: when i was modeling, the position of Solid was the assembly position? The rotational axis of the joint must be coaxial when modeling zhe two Solids, and if they are separated(not coaxial), the rotational axis will not be what i want.

is that soÔºü

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 06/23/2020 08:19:25
The SolidReference is quite simple to use actually, when you add the second joint, instead of adding a `Solid` node in the endPoint field you add a SolidReference node, and you set it's `solidName` to be the name of the Solid in the endpoint field of thefirst joint.

##### ContrastNull 06/23/2020 08:20:16
`@Olivier Michel` you are right sir. I figured that out. The console of inspect element was showing errors, saying the textures were not provided.

##### Rajesh Roy 06/23/2020 08:20:55

##### Jiajun Wang 06/23/2020 08:21:44

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 06/23/2020 08:24:35
> i mean Webots cannot specify the rotation position of the successor of the joint. `@David Mansolino`

`@Jiajun Wang` no because the sucessor is a Solid already existing, so if you want to change the rotation you should change it at the Solid definition

##### Jiajun Wang 06/23/2020 08:25:46
even thought i know how to specify the successor(another Solid, i.e. SolidReference) , I must make sure that the axis of the successor is exactly at the same position of the first Solid?

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 06/23/2020 08:26:29
Then for the axis, you should simply change the anchor field of the joint parameter

`@David Mansolino`  is the photo clear?

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 06/23/2020 08:32:17
The angles you want to set are not at the last jo9nt level, but rather at the intermediary joint level, for which the rotation is completely available.

##### Jiajun Wang 06/23/2020 08:38:30
i have to manually calculate the angle values of q1 and q2, then set value to the jointParameters to make sure the right axis position of the last closed-joint, when i was modeling?

No, you have to add 2 slider-joints one after the other to do this.

##### Jiajun Wang 06/23/2020 08:50:42
planar jointÔºåsorry


What is the minimum mass of a Solid allowed for simulation calculation(ODE physics)?

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 06/23/2020 08:54:19
no minimum. But you should pay attention to avoid big differences between Solid masses to avoid unstabilities

##### Jiajun Wang 06/23/2020 08:57:56
`@David Mansolino` if i model the planar joint one by one, the mass of the intermediary Solid between Joints should be massless or light enough.

##### Tosidis 06/23/2020 13:39:30
will this start using the onboard VGA? or does it still require a more powerfull one?


If you have a headless system, i.e., a system without any physical monitors attached, then with the NVIDIA graphics card you could fake a monitor in the X session


What we want to achieve: Run webots on onboard vga, so the Nvidia stays empty for model training

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 06/23/2020 13:48:00
Webots needs a connection to an X server anyhow. So you can configure it to use the onboard VGA if you need the NVIDIA card for other purposes.


But I never did that and I am not sure whether this is possible at all.

Does the Accelerometer sensor readings include noise ?

##### nap 06/26/2020 04:02:20
In the `nao_robocup` demo, how does one ensure the soccer ball does not roll away when the simulation is started?  I'm using `Webots R2020`.

`@Samir Hosny Mohamed` yes of course, if the noise is defined in the lookup table, then it is included in the reading.

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 06/26/2020 05:31:50
`@nap`: it shouldn't roll away, does it?

##### nap 06/26/2020 05:45:16
`@Olivier Michel` yes, it does.  What I've done is put a solid box to prevent it from running away.  That's fine for my purpose.

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 06/26/2020 05:52:42
For me, the ball doesn't roll away in this simulation. Does it roll away for you before being kicked by a robot?

##### nap 06/26/2020 05:54:05
I moved the ball to one of the penalty spots (near the blue goal). And yes, it rolls away without any other interactions.


I need to make the Nao kneel from a standing position.  If I command it to go to the kneeling position directly, the robot tips over forward.  Is there a way of interpolating the points?

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 06/26/2020 05:57:08
OK, that's because the ball had some initial speed when you saved your simulation. In general, it's not recommended to save a simulation after it has run (you should have received a warning for that). You should re-open the original world file, in which the ball is not initially rolling, stop the simulation, revert the world, move the ball and save the simulation. This way, the ball will not have an initial speed.


About the kneeling behavior, you should generate a trajectory for each motor that ensures that the robot is always in a stable position (the projection of the center of mass on the floor should lie in the support polygon, select a robot and from the View menu -> Optional Rendering -> Show Support Polygon).

##### nap 06/26/2020 06:01:26
I understand what you mean, but there is no speed:

     RobocupSoccerBall {

      translation -3.22 0.0479 0

  }

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 06/26/2020 06:02:27
The speed is stored in a hidden field (you should open the world file in a text editor to see it).

##### nap 06/26/2020 06:02:48
Yes, that's where I got that stanza from.

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 06/26/2020 06:04:25
It there any initial collision with that ball which may cause an initial motion?

##### nap 06/26/2020 06:05:24
No.  I thought it may have something to do with how the ball was contacting the ground, so I've changed the Y axis from the normal 0.5, to bring it down.  But it still does that.

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 06/26/2020 06:07:51
Well, if I edit the original file and set the ball position to `-3.22 0.05 0`, the ball stays still when I start the simulation.


Can you do this as well?

##### nap 06/26/2020 06:11:04
Yep, it does not move.


Here is the world I'm having the problem with.  There do not appear to be any hidden velocities or inertia.

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 06/26/2020 06:20:55
It's simply a collision with the feet of the robots. Moving the two robot slightly backwards fixes the problem.

Yes.

##### nap 06/26/2020 07:25:26
What parameter would I use to do this?  Say RHipPitch


This is what the proto has for RHipPitch:

                      RotationalMotor {

                        name "RHipPitch"

                        maxVelocity 6.40239

                        minPosition -1.77378

                        maxPosition 0.48398

                        maxTorque %{= (version == "3.3") and 8 or 9.8 }%

                      }

Hi! You mean you want to change the initial joint angles?

##### Stanislas Larnier 06/26/2020 07:48:22
`@David Mansolino` Yes.

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 06/26/2020 07:53:18
That's possible, but very tricky and unrecommended. The simplest solution is either to convert the node to base node (right click in the scene tree on the node) either to edit the PROTO to open these fields.

##### EPIC 06/26/2020 08:05:04
Hi! Is it possible to edit Def-names in run-time?

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 06/26/2020 08:06:42
Yes of course, the USE nodes will be changed accordingly too.

##### EPIC 06/26/2020 08:07:06
Also when importing a node in run-time: I want to import a robot from the console, but not inside another field. Is this possible, since the "import"-functions derive from "Field"?


What command could I use in that case, to change the Def name? üôÇ

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 06/26/2020 08:08:55
Yes, you can use the `wb_supervisor_node_get_root` function that gets the root node: [https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/supervisor#wb\_supervisor\_node\_get\_root](https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/supervisor#wb_supervisor_node_get_root)


The root node is a hidden  `Group` node, you can therefore get its 'children' field.

##### EPIC 06/26/2020 08:11:22
Aaah, I thought that gave you the root of the robot.. very nice! Is there also a command like "setDef(self, string)" ?

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 06/26/2020 08:12:01
No, this is unfortunately not possible.


By the way, to get the root of the robot it is the `wb_supervisor_node_get_self` function üòâ

##### EPIC 06/26/2020 08:13:51
Ok üòâ How about setting the Def-name while importing? Like in one of the examples, this function is being used: "wb\_supervisor\_field\_import\_mf\_node\_from\_string(root\_children\_field, 4, "DEF MY\_ROBOT Robot { controller \"my\_controller\" }")". 

Is there a specific robot with the name MY\_ROBOT being imported, or are they setting the name of the robot while importing?

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 06/26/2020 08:14:52
You import should work, it will create the DEF when importing

##### nap 06/26/2020 08:44:33
`@David Mansolino` :  I did what you suggested about exploding the proto into base nodes.

As such, I've been able to get the Nao into the pose I want.  But how can I put them all back so they work as a Nao again?

Never mind, dumb question.....  Just select the same Root Node.


`@David Mansolino` :  Worked really well.  Essentially wasted the last 3 hrs stuffing around.

##### nelsondmmg 06/26/2020 10:06:20
Hi, does webots have defined as expression to calculate the lateral stiffness of the tire (or the lateral force generated by the tire given the slip angle) for the different vehicles available? Thanks.

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 06/26/2020 10:17:25
This is handle by our physicy engine, everything is defined in the contact properties, it is not defined in the wheel model, but rather in the world definition: [https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/contactproperties](https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/contactproperties)

##### Robsicky 06/26/2020 11:14:38
I've exported some .vrl 3D models from blender, but when I attach them to a solids in Webots, their origin get shifted (relative to the solid frame of reference). Anyone got an idea on how to get this right? I'm not too familiar with the .vrl format.

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 06/26/2020 11:15:22
Is the origin of the model correctly set in Blender?

##### Robsicky 06/26/2020 11:16:46
Pretty sure, yes. Not too familiar with Blender either, thoughüôÉ

And it's not a small offset in Webots either. Meters.

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 06/26/2020 11:17:59
Looks correct indeed. Is there some transforms once imported in Webots?

##### Robsicky 06/26/2020 11:24:32
Problem solved. Was my incompetence in Blender that caused the problem. I made the offset on my model to get it out of the "default" blender box the first time i exported to vrl.


Blender UI got a discombobulating effect. The exported model from the pic above had no offset. Thank you!

##### Lifebinder (tsampazk) 06/26/2020 12:57:59
hello! i got the following error " [javascript] Uncaught RangeError: Failed to execute 'getImageData' on 'CanvasRenderingContext2D': Out of memory at ImageData creation (timeplot\_widget.js:130)" which i guess comes from robot windows. 

The thing is that i am not using robot windows whatsoever. Any idea where it might originate? 

(I got it on ubuntu 20.04, running python controllers for the robots)


Webots seems to have somehow silently crashed, the UI is responsive but the simulation won't run after this error (which appeared in white in the console)

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 06/26/2020 13:00:26
Hi, do you have it with the samples simulations? If yes, with all of them?

##### Lifebinder (tsampazk) 06/26/2020 13:54:12
`@David Mansolino` no, it's on my own project and it popped up just once after many hours of simulated time üòï


Should i try to run a sample simulation to see if it pops up again?

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 06/26/2020 13:56:51
It would indeed help to reproduce the issue on a standard sample so that we can investigate it.

##### Lifebinder (tsampazk) 06/26/2020 14:02:21
Ok then, i'll keep you updated if it occurs again, thank you!

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 06/26/2020 14:03:08
Perfect, thank you.

Hello all, 



I am using webots 2019, and I'd like to remove the Physics SFNode within a simple solid object for a short time period and then re-enable the physics.  From the docs, I understand there should be an importSFNodeFromString function for the physics field of a Solid, however i get an attribute error when I try this.  running dir(Field-object) shows the following screenshot.  From this I conclude that there is not, in fact, the function I would like to use.  Can anyone make a comment or recommendation for me?

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 06/27/2020 12:27:21
What is the quickest way to get all motor and sensor nodes of a robot / world? The nature of the .proto files makes them verry slow to dig through

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 06/27/2020 14:31:42
`@Simon Steinmann`: double-click on the robot to open the robot window where all the devices should be listed.

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 06/27/2020 14:32:37
`@Olivier Michel` that only works, when the joints and motors are already initialized through the controller.


to do that, I need the names


do you have a script by any chance, that uses a supervisor node to get all devices in a world by going through the scene tree?

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 06/27/2020 15:38:40
I don't believe the devices need to be enabled to see them in the robot window. So running the void controller should be sufficient to display device names in the robot window.

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 06/27/2020 15:42:17
ohhh, starting it with a void controller is the answer üòÑ


thank you üôÇ


is there a command to retrieve all devices via code?

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 06/27/2020 15:46:55
No, however you can have a look at the source code of the generic html robot window to understand how a robot can automatically generate the list of its devices.

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 06/27/2020 15:48:09
I might check it out when I have time. I'm working on the 3f robotiq gripper. The proto you guys have in webots, has the wrong joint limits. Do you want me to create a PR with an updated proto?

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 06/27/2020 15:50:01
See this function: [https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/robot#wb\_robot\_get\_device\_by\_index](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/robot#wb_robot_get_device_by_index)

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 06/27/2020 15:50:35
uhh, that looks promising

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 06/27/2020 15:50:38
Yes, that would be great.

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 06/27/2020 15:51:00
alright, I'll create one, once I verified everything


`@Olivier Michel`  Woooow... I just discovered a major bug!


a motor CAN'T have a positive minPosition and a negative maxPosition


when minPosition is positive, or maxPosition is negative, getting those Values returns a 0


this is true for using the node api, as well as checking the motors in webots robot view

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 06/27/2020 16:08:19
That's normal minPosition should be inferior to maxPosition.

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 06/27/2020 16:09:00
what do you mean?


for example, this is not possible
%figure

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 06/27/2020 16:09:57
Really? It should work normally. If not, that's a bug and you should report it.

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 06/27/2020 16:13:30
can you check quickly whether it is the same for you?
> **Attachment**: [ur10e\_gripper.zip](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/565154703139405824/726470275675324456/ur10e_gripper.zip)


just with a void controller, moving the motors of the gripper


I'm running a nightly build from 2 moth ago or so


I think I have found the issue. I didn't dive deep into the code, but it seems to reset min and max pos, if the current value is not inbetween
%figure

%end


And I'm guessing that the default position of the parentJoint = 0. So if we dont explicitly define it, the position is 0, and minPosition / maxPosition get's reset, if above or below 0

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 06/27/2020 16:38:01
Yes, that's it.

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 06/27/2020 16:40:31
I submitted a bug report on gitlab just now


I suck at cpp, so I wont try to provide a solution, but I think it should set the position to either the min or max position (whichever is closer to 0)


The PR for the correct 3f-robotiq gripper will have to wait I guess üòÑ

Well, I think I found it!

The black-coloured boundaries appeared when I render bounding object CTRL+F2 and when I pressed them back again they were gone and turned to white

The red ones were the same shape defined more than once instead of using the USE keyword

Kindly, correct me if I'm wrong

`@kentevan` this function is not available in R2019, it was added in R2020a: [https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/changelog-r2020#webots-r2020a](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/changelog-r2020#webots-r2020a)

`@chenpixx` no, but you can easily create your own.

`@l_eslam_l` not exactly, the red ones are the ones that are colliding another object.

what is the difference between DeviceTag and NodeRef? And how can I get a nodehandle from a device?

##### Stefania Pedrazzi [cyberbotics] 06/29/2020 11:43:27
`@Simon Steinmann`:

- a NodeRef is reference to the node instance: this is used mainly by the Supervisor API to get/set fields.

- a DeviceTag is a unique number that identifies the nodes (mainly devices nodes) on the controller side and that is used by the device APIs to to call device-specific functions.

The best way to get a NodeRef is to directly use the Supervisor API (for example retrieving the node from the DEF name).


There is no direct method to get the NodeRef from a DeviceTag because they are used in different classes and for different purposes.

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 06/29/2020 12:24:00
I can easily retrieve a list of all devices in a world. Would be nice to be able to get the node handles too

##### Stefania Pedrazzi [cyberbotics] 06/29/2020 12:25:20
At the moment you can get all the NodeRef instances by looping through the robot or scene using the Supervisor API and check for the type.

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 06/29/2020 12:25:36
is there an example script?

##### Stefania Pedrazzi [cyberbotics] 06/29/2020 12:28:15
You can adapt and extend the controller from samples/devices/supervisor.wbt simulation: 

[https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/samples-devices#supervisor-wbt](https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/samples-devices#supervisor-wbt)

[https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots/blob/master/projects/samples/devices/controllers/sample\_supervisor/sample\_supervisor.c](https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots/blob/master/projects/samples/devices/controllers/sample_supervisor/sample_supervisor.c)


note that this not very efficient if you have to parse the whole scene tree

##### yash 06/29/2020 14:35:25

`@David Mansolino` I can talk to my team about that, but we are working on a bit of a deadline and I anticipate that being an unpopular option.  Is there any other way?

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 06/29/2020 15:10:10
Unfortunately the SFNode manipulation was not available in R2019. A workaround could be to create a procedural PROTO with a boolean field defining if the node has physics or not: [https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/procedural-proto-nodes](https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/procedural-proto-nodes)


Here is an example doing this with a simple object:

  - [https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots/blob/master/projects/objects/garden/protos/Gnome.proto#L11](https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots/blob/master/projects/objects/garden/protos/Gnome.proto#L11)

  - [https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots/blob/master/projects/objects/garden/protos/Gnome.proto#L84-L96](https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots/blob/master/projects/objects/garden/protos/Gnome.proto#L84-L96)

##### kentevan 06/29/2020 15:11:21
ahh, so replace the node I want to manipulate with one that does not have physics, do the manipulation, then replace again with one that does have physics

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 06/29/2020 15:11:42
> ahh, so replace the node I want to manipulate with one that does not have physics, do the manipulation, then replace again with one that does have physics

`@kentevan` that's another possibility indeed.

##### kentevan 06/29/2020 15:17:26
`@David Mansolino` just to clarify for myself:  is this physics field changeable mid-simulation?  The overall goal here is to differentiate a demonstrated motion from a robot action by making the demonstrated motion separate from robot actuation.  I am running the object through a generated path by directly manipulating the translation field of the solid object, but as soon as there is a pause, the object drops as it is beholden to physics.  My understanding of the above code is that a proto object can be instantiated with one value of the physics boolean field, but this would not allow "toggling" of the physics.  Is that correct?

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 06/29/2020 15:18:50
Yes, if you create a PROTO, you can create a condition around the physics (like in the example I sent), and then change in runtime from the supervisor the field that is trigerring this condition.


(I am sorry I have to leave, but I will be here again from tomorrow morning)

##### kentevan 06/29/2020 15:29:28
No problem, thank you for the insight.  So if an object is added to the world, the physics field will be present or not depending on some condition, but there is no way to change this field once instantiated.  However subsequent objects will be affected by that condition when they are spawned

##### Stefania Pedrazzi [cyberbotics] 06/29/2020 15:32:25
`@kentevan` not sure what you mean by subsequent objects...

if you toggle the "physics" field (from the scene tree or a supervisor controller), the object will be deleted and new object with the new physcis condition will be instantiated, so you won't practically notice the object regeneration

##### kentevan 06/29/2020 15:35:46
`@Stefania Pedrazzi` You're right I just re-read what he wrote and realized I misinterpreted it.  Too much coffee this morning, need to slow down and read things completely!  That makes sense, thank you for clarifying

##### lojik 06/29/2020 17:22:07
Hello everyone,

I have two small questions :



1. How can I access to the controllerArgs in python, Webots 2020b Nightly Build 9/6/2020 ?



I tried like this, without success :

world = Supervisor()

    args = world.getControllerArguments()



It gives this error :

AttributeError: type object 'object' has no attribute '\_\_getattr\_\_'



2. Someone can confirm me that it is normal to not be able to change the maxTorque value of a device with getField('maxTorque').setSFFloat(param.MAX\_TORQUE) ?



Thank you


Ok, for the first point, I finally managed to take the argument with :



world.getFromDef("Robot").getField('controllerArgs').getMFString(0)

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 06/30/2020 05:01:32
`@lojik` you can access it like you would access any arguments of a python script, e.g. `sys.argv`.


That's not normal for the maxTorque, what is not working exactly?

You're welcome

##### lojik 06/30/2020 07:20:56
`@David Mansolino` Thank your for your answers and sorry, I did not think to check on python side for arguments...



For the torque, last time we discussed about some parameters that stays constant during simulation. I did not expected torques to be in these ones. Actually my controller is run by webots. But inside the controller I have a "setup" fonction to modify some world parameters. But as you suggested I should do inverse. Set in the world file then load it.

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 06/30/2020 07:36:55
You're welcome


torque should indeed not be one of these constant parameters (if it is, then it is a bug), let me check.


I checked and it seems to work, what is not working exactly?

##### lojik 06/30/2020 08:55:58
What I would like to do when loading the world is to modify some of the parameters automatically to be sure having the same parameters from one simulation to an other. So I do it like follow with some parameters :



sup.getFromDef('motor\_{}'.format(i+1)).getField('maxTorque').setSFFloat(param.MAX\_TORQUE)

%end


But as shown on this plot, torques are not bounded by MAX\_TORQUE = 100

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 06/30/2020 08:58:03
Ok, how are you getting the value you plot?

##### lojik 06/30/2020 08:58:57
I get them with the getTorques Webots function.

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 06/30/2020 08:59:33
getTorqueFeedback ?

##### lojik 06/30/2020 09:00:06
Yes, sorry

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 06/30/2020 09:01:44
Ok, have you tried using `getAvailableTorque` and `getMaxTorque` just to make sure the value you set is taken into account?

##### lojik 06/30/2020 09:03:17
No, I did not check with these. I tried using setAvailableTorque with the same value as MAX\_TORQUE and it worked. So I thought that did not change the value as expected. I will try it now.


Ok, what I saw is that it change the value in Webots interface but not when I call functions like getMaxTorque. And it is not taken into account in the controller.

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 06/30/2020 09:06:49
And about  getAvailableTorque?

##### lojik 06/30/2020 09:07:42
The same results, it changes only if I set with setAvailableTorque() function

##### Jajaka 06/30/2020 09:08:32
my webots always stack while create directory on wizard

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 06/30/2020 09:08:40
Ok, so both getMaxTorque and getAvailableTorque returns the old value? Unless you explicitely set it wihth setAvailableTorque, am I correct?

Yep, it is exactly what I have üëç

`@David Mansolino` Ok I note that and I will take time to do it next week. Unfortunately I have to finish my master thesis this Friday and cannot give you my files as they are.

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 06/30/2020 09:38:52
No problem, next week is fine too, thank you.

Sure will do it ... but will it be a problem if I use it now .?

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 06/30/2020 09:41:53
No, don't worry, this shouldn't prevent you at all from using Webots.

May I ask you also to try with a beta version of R2020b available here: [https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots/releases](https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots/releases)

I think this problem is already fixed in our development environment.

##### Jatin Sharma 06/30/2020 09:47:51
> `@Jatin Sharma` is your controller compiled?

`@David Mansolino` Hi yes, i tried running in Ubuntu it worked well. Seems like the webots running on windows is not able to communicate with the simulation environment running in the Ubuntu WSL. Thanks for your support.

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 06/30/2020 09:49:01
That's indeed possible, I never tried using WSL. You may use extern controller to workaround this issue, this way you can start yourself the controller instead of letting Webots doing it for you: [https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/running-extern-robot-controllers](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/running-extern-robot-controllers)

##### Robsicky 06/30/2020 12:02:24
Hi. Quick question. I'm using "importMFNode( )" to import a solid as child of another solid. Is there a method to get the ID for this new import? Or maybe better, set the ID when importing?

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 06/30/2020 12:04:17
You cannot set the ID when importing, Webots will do it automatically.


I am not sure what do you mean by ID? WbNodeRef?


If so, you can retrieve it from `getMFNode()` after the import.

##### Robsicky 06/30/2020 12:05:43
Unique identifier?


To use as arg in getFromID( ) later


Is this the same as WbNodeRef?

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 06/30/2020 12:15:24
I see, then you should call `parentNode.getMFNode().getId()` to get the ID.

##### Stanislas Larnier 06/30/2020 12:55:35
Hi. Do you know some example in Webots of a robotic arm with a vacuum gripper (suction cup)? It is the last missing part of my simulation. It could make me win some time. Thank in advance.

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 06/30/2020 12:58:53
Hi, I know one but unfortunately can't share it as this one is condifential, but the idea is quite simple, you can use 2 connector devices, one at the end of the arm (in the vacuum gripper) and the other on the object to grasp.

##### Robsicky 06/30/2020 13:17:10
I'm having some trouble setting the geometry size of a shape within a solid. My attempt is:

```
box_child = box.getField("children")
box_shape = box_child.getMFNode(0)
shape_geometry = box_shape.getMFNode(0)
geometry_field = shape_geometry.getField("size")
```

Goal is to set the "size" field, but don


... but don't know how to reach it*


Also, please ignore my terrible (temporary) variable names üôÉ

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 06/30/2020 13:22:57
You can't get the box geometry this way. You should retrieve from the geometry field.


```python
shape_geometry = box_shape.getField('geometry').getSFNode()
```

##### Robsicky 06/30/2020 13:29:30
Thanks a lot! This gives me "geometry" node? And from there I can get "size" field, and set/get vector?

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 06/30/2020 13:33:20
Yes.


As a hint, you can check the return value of these getter functions and if you get `None`, that means it failed to retrieve the requested node or field. In your first example, `shape_geometry` was probably set to `None`.

##### Robsicky 06/30/2020 13:36:38
Perfect. It worksü•≥  Thank you very much!

##### Soft\_illusion 07/01/2020 01:36:30
Any suggestions on how to dynamically change proto in the Webots simulators? While it is running.

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 07/01/2020 05:25:58
What do you mean by change PROTO? You want to chang the some internal fields/nodes of the PROTO from the Supervisor?

##### Bharath Kumar 07/01/2020 09:49:31
Hi, This is Bharath. I frequently get an issue while working with Webots. I can't modify the parameters in the scene try at times. Now after two restarts of the Webots application, I can modify the parameters. I has been happening a few times now. Why am I getting this issue?

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 07/01/2020 09:52:56
Which parameters are you tryign to change? And how?

What do you mean by you can't, is Webots crashing?

##### aalmanso 07/01/2020 10:06:28
Hi, I made an experiment using e-puck. Every regular time the robot place in a random position and rotation inside arena. By using supervisor function I doing that, but the problem is sometimes the robot rolls and turns( like a ball) and not stable at arena in correct way. Please any suggestions to disable this feature inside webots?

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 07/01/2020 10:11:36
Make sure that:


- The robot is not colliding with an object or the floor when you move it from the supervisor.

  - Once you have moved it, reset the physics of the robot from the supervisor too.

##### Robsicky 07/01/2020 10:49:24
Hi. Trying to "build" PROTOs. When inserting into world, I'm not allowed to translate from the "graphical frame" of the PROTO. I can rotate. Does anyone know what might be causing this?

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 07/01/2020 10:51:05
`@Robsicky` do you PROTO have a `translation` and a `rotation` fields ?

##### w3. eydi 07/01/2020 10:52:58
For the quadruped spot, I need parameters to be able to apply the trajectory I have specified with inverse kinematics. How can I find? Or Are there any created equations? I could not find it in documentation.

%end

##### Robsicky 07/01/2020 10:54:34
Yes. And I can translate via the translation field of the Proto. Just not "graphically".

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 07/01/2020 10:56:26
> Yes. And I can translate via the translation field of the Proto. Just not "graphically".

`@Robsicky` Are they connected in the PROTO using `IS` statement or generated (using lua for example)?

##### Robsicky 07/01/2020 10:57:13
I was using "IS".

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 07/01/2020 10:57:27
> For the quadruped spot, I need parameters to be able to apply the trajectory I have specified with inverse kinematics. How can I find? Or Are there any created equations? I could not find it in documentation.

`@w3. eydi` you should be able to find them in the documentation of the real spot robot. Or you can convert the robot to base node to extract them from the model (right click on the spot node => 'Convert to Base Node(s)').

##### Robsicky 07/01/2020 11:00:42
I was setting translations and rotations using lua for "child frames". The graphical frame is the one linked to the translation and rotation field? What happens if several children "inherit" translation via "IS"?

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 07/01/2020 11:01:34
That would likely make strange results...


Normally, you should IS connect only the main translation and rotation for a PROTO.

##### Robsicky 07/01/2020 11:02:50
Ah, makes sense. Can always set translation/rotation etc to be the same as the field using lua, I guess?


The graphical translation of my PROTO disappears when i do

```
%{trans = fields.translation.value}%
```

##### Stefania Pedrazzi [cyberbotics] 07/01/2020 11:28:42
yes, this is correct. Graphical handles are not displayed if the translation/rotation fields are not open PROTO fields, or if they are template/lua fields.

The best practice if you are using the translation and rotation fields for inner child nodes is to rename them (for example using "childTranslation").

##### Robsicky 07/01/2020 11:34:01
Not sure if I understand your last sentence. I want to keep the graphical handle, but also want to use its values for inner child.

##### Stefania Pedrazzi [cyberbotics] 07/01/2020 11:35:30
the best practice would be to use other fields with other names for the inner child. Otherwise the graphical handle for the top PROTO node won't be visible

##### Robsicky 07/01/2020 11:38:37
Is it possible to make these fields equal to the trans/rot fields?

##### Stefania Pedrazzi [cyberbotics] 07/01/2020 11:43:49
Yes, but if you use them in template/lua statement, then you won't have the graphical handles visible in the 3D scene


The only option is to use the IS statement instead of the template/lua statement. But also in this case, the graphical handles will only be displayed if the field is also IS connected to the base node translation field


I know that this could not be very clear, but to get the graphical translation/rotation handle in the 3D view for a PROTO node these three conditions has to be fullfilled:

1. "translation"/"rotation" words should not be used in template/lua statements

2. The `translation`/`rotation` field of the PROTO base node should be IS connected with an open PROTO field


3. The `translation`/`rotation` field of the PROTO base node should not be set using a lua statement

##### Robsicky 07/01/2020 11:52:38
I understand. I think I got an idea on how to "solve" my PROTO now. Thanks!

##### l\_eslam\_l 07/01/2020 20:48:46
Hello,

I'm trying to run ROS with Webots

But I'm not sure whether webots\_ros is working or not

When I try robot\_information\_parser, what should the output be? I get nothing in the terminal nor in webots console

Also pioneer3at example, the robot doesn't move


I don't know what I'm missing

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 07/01/2020 22:15:04
Do you want to implement ROS yourself?


then I suggest running your ROS code externally, and using the < extern> controller inside webots

##### l\_eslam\_l 07/01/2020 22:29:58
Thank you for your response.

But the documentation says that unless we want to create our own controller, we should use the standard "ros" controller, it's an interface between webots and the ROS network.

But the given examples seemingly don't work!


It only works when I run roscore and the node of the robot I want separately then starting webots and open the .wbt file of the same robot

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 07/01/2020 22:50:04
Running ROS inside of webots has some peculiarities. For example, the code is only running, if you have the step(timestep) function inside of your main loop


you can run your ROS code in an external Terminal / IDE. much simpler


[https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/installation-procedure#extern-controllers](https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/installation-procedure#extern-controllers)


might need to read the extern-controllers part

##### l\_eslam\_l 07/01/2020 23:40:46

[nao\_demo] total: 100 Newtons, 10.1937 kilograms

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 07/02/2020 06:34:37
What do you mean by nano ??

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 07/02/2020 06:37:24
I checked the `nao_demo.wbt` simulation and the total mass of the robot is 5.3 kg and the mass measured by the foot sensors is 6.1 kg which makes an error of 0.8 kg that can be explained by the dynamics model.


When the robot walks, the measurements oscillate between 5 and 8 kg, which seems fair.


You will probably get similar results with the real robot.


(depending on the calibration)

##### l\_eslam\_l 07/02/2020 08:36:36
`@David Mansolino`

Yeah, I tried all of them,  non of them are working

The only way it works when I run the world and the ROS nodes separately 

Actually I did have this problem a while ago, but I changed my laptop so I'm doing it all over again but the same problem appeared


Where should the installation directory of webots be on linux?

Mine is in /usr/local/webots

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 07/02/2020 08:41:03

Melodic

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 07/02/2020 08:41:27
It all depends on how you installed Webots. but /usr/local/webots with the debian package is correct


have you defined 'WEBOTS\_HOME' before starting the launch file?

##### l\_eslam\_l 07/02/2020 08:42:20
Yeah I did, export WEBOTS\_HOME=/usr/local/ webots/


In .bashrc file

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 07/02/2020 08:50:16
Ok, in that case that's probabyl a bug, but I am sorry I don't have the time to look at it right now, can you please open an issue here so that we can fix it soon: [https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots\_ros/issues/new](https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots_ros/issues/new)

`@David Mansolino` I am still getting the /usr/local/bin/webots line 86 (core dumped error).


We tried to do some tests in which we relocate 2 robots to the same position of the environment, and we experience the turn off problem.


But we still don't know if the collisions that can end up in this situation is the responsible for this problem.


Is there a more effective way to debug this problem?

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 07/03/2020 07:02:52
I am sorry, but can please refresh my memory by summarizing the initial problem (I am sorry, but I had probably more than 100 other questions since last time we spoke üòÖ )

##### Luiz Felipe 07/03/2020 07:04:49
hehehe ok. Actually I think last time I also explained about another problem.


While running my environment I sometimes experiences webots turning off. With the following kind of message:



%figure
![unknown.png](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/565154703139405824/728506699656200242/unknown.png)
%end


I have the intuition that this can be related to collisions, or other situation that the physics cannot handle.


We tried to do some tests in which we relocate 2 robots to the same position on the environment, and we experienced webots turning off like this also.


But we don't know how to solve that, which part of the environment to simplify to solve that...


Is there a way to exactly know where the problem is happening?

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 07/03/2020 07:09:27
This is indeed a crash. The simplest solution to find where it comes from is to try to reproduce the crash in a very simple example.

Alternatively, if you know how GDB works I can provide you a debug version of Webots so that you can try generating a stack.

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 07/03/2020 07:17:05
`@Luiz Felipe`: which version of Webots are you using?

##### Luiz Felipe 07/03/2020 07:17:08
Yes. The way we tried to reproduce was relocating two robots to the same position. But we don't if that is what actually happen in our environment right before the crash.


R2020a revision 1

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 07/03/2020 07:18:00
In that case you might use the contrary, make sure you never relocate two robots to the same position and check if it still crashes.

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 07/03/2020 07:19:40
It also may be worth trying with a recent nightly build of Webots R2020a revision 2 or R2020b as we fixed several crashes since the release of R2020a revision 1.

##### Luiz Felipe 07/03/2020 07:20:57
oh... ok. I will see if it is possible to port directly to R2020b and test again.


I will try to realize if it is really related to collisions. If it is, I think i will need to use the debug version with GDB `@David Mansolino` , even I am not very familiar with that.

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 07/03/2020 07:24:15
ok perfect, let us know.

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 07/03/2020 07:58:00
`@Luiz Felipe`: they were some little changes, but it should be working. Can you try to replace your Makefile with one coming with the version of Webots you installed?


See for example: [https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots/blob/master/projects/robots/clearpath/moose/controllers/moose\_path\_following/Makefile](https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots/blob/master/projects/robots/clearpath/moose/controllers/moose_path_following/Makefile)

ok, thank you, I will try


I am sorry, but i just checked and it worked perfectly for me.

Here is the complete instruction I used, maybe you should try if this one works fine for you too:

```Python
self.getRoot().getField('children').importMFNode(3,'Glass.wbo')
```


It is worth testign with the beta of R2020b ([https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots/releases](https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots/releases)) too.

##### chenpixx 07/03/2020 08:52:51
Thanks, now there is no error but I see the glass  after the first reset  and the other resets later it vanish. I wait to see it during one/more  episode. If I use      while not self.step(self.timeStep) == -1:

         self.getRoot().getField('children').importMFNode(3,'Glass.wbo'), figure is below as:

As documented (see 'Reset Simulation': [https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/the-user-interface#file-menu](https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/the-user-interface#file-menu)) the reset will remove all the nodes inserted.

Hi. When I use

on my camera, it mostly returns None. Does anyone know the reason for this? My camera is enabled.

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 07/03/2020 11:51:13
Hi,

Which language are you using?

Are you doing at least one step between the enable and the getImageArray?

##### Robsicky 07/03/2020 11:55:19
I'm using python. And yes, I enable several steps before getImageArray

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 07/03/2020 11:57:19
Ok, in that case it should ineed not return nay None value. the fucntion is returning directly None, or the array is filled with None value?

None directly

just move the  code or related files of a world in webots to another platform like QT ,and simulate it.

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 07/03/2020 13:14:25
Do you have .protos of kinova arms?

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 07/03/2020 13:15:04
> just move the  code or related files of a world in webots to another platform like QT ,and simulate it.

`@tangdan` Webots model and worlds can be used by Webots only.


> Do you have .protos of kinova arms?

`@Simon Steinmann` no, but it should be quite simple to convert one from URDF as we have already tested our URDF converter with some kinova model and it was working quite well: [https://github.com/cyberbotics/urdf2webots#notes](https://github.com/cyberbotics/urdf2webots#notes)

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 07/03/2020 13:18:01
It would be nice to have a "alpha" version of more robots. Say I make a proto for a kinova arm, it would be nice if other people can get it too. And vice versa ofc


I know that optimizing a model is more work, but having some working sample easily accessible would be nice


would make webots more attractive as well, if people can simply load their stuff

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 07/03/2020 13:19:47
Yes sure, but if you create a model, do not hesitate to create a pull request to include it in Webots: [https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots](https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots)

I know that we are a bit picky with the model quality for integrating them, but it is on our roadmap to create a system allowing users to upload model in beta quality.


Worse case feel free to create a github repository with your model and we can then host it under the 'cyberbotics' Github organization.

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 07/03/2020 13:20:49
Perhaps we can create something temporary, where people can easily upload

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 07/03/2020 13:21:35

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 07/03/2020 13:22:33
perhaps you can make a new repository with 'community-beta-models' or 'unofficial models'

Hi again. Another question about cameras/getImageArray().

I'm trying to extract an image  in 1080p, but my simulation halts for 2-4 seconds when doing "getImageArray()". Is there anything I can do about this?

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 07/03/2020 14:19:17
The `getImageArray` implies a conversion to create the array pixel by pixel which is costly, you might use `getImage` instead for better performances.


Here is an example: [https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots/blob/master/projects/samples/robotbenchmark/visual\_tracking/controllers/visual\_tracking/visual\_tracking.py#L114-L133](https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots/blob/master/projects/samples/robotbenchmark/visual_tracking/controllers/visual_tracking/visual_tracking.py#L114-L133)

`@Doc` probably that the one not receiving shadows has an alpha channel, if a textures has an alpha channel then the object is considered as partially transparent and therefore doesn't receive or cast shadows

as `@Simon Steinmann` said, you should be able to improve the stability by simplifying the bounding objects (make sure to use only basic geometries such as box, sphere, cylinder, etc.)

`@mint` the problem come from the fact that you are using the snap package, the snap package is running in a kind of sandbox and does not have access to external modules. You should either use another installation procedure for Webots either use extern controller: [https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/running-extern-robot-controllers](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/running-extern-robot-controllers)

They all have the same DEF, as I import the same object in run-time (a robot is picking up a box - I'm importing a box inside the grippers child-node, and deletes the original box when picking it up). To keep track of all the boxes, I sort them by ID

##### Stefania Pedrazzi [cyberbotics] 07/06/2020 09:35:05
It is also possible to import objects in runtime and set a different DEF name

##### EPIC 07/06/2020 09:35:31
Oh, really? That would be a better solution indeed


How could I set a different DEF name? üôÇ

##### Stefania Pedrazzi [cyberbotics] 07/06/2020 09:38:01
With the Supervisor API you can also import a node from string:

[https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/supervisor#wb\_supervisor\_field\_import\_mf\_node\_from\_string](https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/supervisor#wb_supervisor_field_import_mf_node_from_string)


so you can dynamically build the string in the controller


for example storing all the box description in a variable (or file) and just adding the DEF name part dynamically just before calling the import instruction


this is for example done in the SumoSupervisor controller: [https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots/blob/master/projects/default/controllers/sumo\_supervisor/Objects.py#L158](https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots/blob/master/projects/default/controllers/sumo_supervisor/Objects.py#L158)

##### EPIC 07/06/2020 09:48:26
Ah, clever.. I didn't understand how to use it from the documentation, but that example were really nice. Will see if I can make it work as in the example, thank you!

hi, how can i get a navigation controller to a specific target, i will use it to implement my model

##### yash 07/06/2020 09:54:14
Hello .!

I am using Webots with ROS . I am programming a publisher and subscriber node using visual studio code , then should have to save the nodes in the source file(src) of  webots\_ros Package? 

And what about the controller field of the robot node , which controller should I select there .?

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 07/06/2020 09:56:32
Hi `@yash` if yoru publisher and subscriber is using the services and topics provided by the default ros controller of Webots, you should simply assign the controller to 'ros'. Here are some example: [https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots\_ros](https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots_ros)

##### Stefania Pedrazzi [cyberbotics] 07/06/2020 09:57:19
Hi `@Emna`, knokwing the target position you can use for example the GPS device to compare the current position with the target position and compute the motion direction. Based on that you just have to set your robot motors to move in that direction.


Webots doesn't include any built-in generic navigation controller, in the provided simulations the robots are mainly using obstacle detection based on sensors

##### Emna 07/06/2020 10:01:59

What do you mean exactly by 'fixed frame'.

Since you can now the resolution and field of views of the camera, if you know the position and orientation of your camera (which you can get using a gps and inertial unit for example) you have everything you need to compute the object position (except the distance).

It seems you are not using the standard controller, what does 'webots\_test01.py? contain?

Did you set the PYTHONPATH to point to the Webots Python library?

Something like this: [https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots/blob/33d834e8debcc7c38a9be1144a48ae52971d303e/projects/languages/ros/webots\_ros/launch/webots\_ros\_python.launch#L12-L13](https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots/blob/33d834e8debcc7c38a9be1144a48ae52971d303e/projects/languages/ros/webots_ros/launch/webots_ros_python.launch#L12-L13)

Not necessarily, you can also define yourself the  `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` and `PYTHONPATH` environment variable before starting your node (see more explanation here: [https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/running-extern-robot-controllers?tab-os=linux&tab-language=python#environment-variables](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/running-extern-robot-controllers?tab-os=linux&tab-language=python#environment-variables))

But when i add the pr2 robot for example to my world and project the robot does the things he do in the demo and uses the controller from demo. all i want is to use the robot but to code myself the controller. Can someone help me with some answers or to explain me what i've to do ? i know it sounds dumb ,but as i said i'm new to Webots .I tried to look up for other tutorials than the cyberbotics ones and i couldn't find  things related to my problem.

`@ùë≥ùë∂ùëπùë´ ùë∂ùëµùë∞` you can change your controller here. If you want to create a new controller inside webots, use the wizard (top of the screen). If you select extern, you can have your controller running outside in your Terminal or IDE of your choice

##### EPIC 07/08/2020 08:16:07
Hi! I'm having trouble with my touch sensor. The bounding object of the sensor is set at the end-effector of a robot, and is working just fine when there is nothing attached to the end-effector. But when the end-effector (gripper) is picking something up, the touch sensor doesn't work anymore (it starts working when I let go of the object that I picked up). Any idea why this could be happening?

Additional info: I'm not using physics (pure kinematic simulation). When I grab/pick up an object, I'm importing the object as a child of the end-effector/gripper (and then remove/delete the original object). When I put the object down/let go, I reverse the process (import the object into the world, then remove/delete the child-object from the end-effector/gripper).

The output from the touch sensor is != 1 while I'm holding the object, both while overlapping other bounding objects and not

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 07/08/2020 08:20:04
Hi, does the object you imported overlap the bounding object of the touch sensor?

##### EPIC 07/08/2020 08:20:53
No :/ I also tried to add the object as a child before I started the simulation - then everything worked just fine

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 07/08/2020 08:23:58
Ok, in that case that is maybe a bug, can you try reproducing the issue with a very simple example (even if it implies adding manually the new object while the siulation is running) and report it here: [https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots/issues/new?template=bug\_report.md](https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots/issues/new?template=bug_report.md)

thank you

##### EPIC 07/08/2020 08:43:13
Sure üôÇ I manually added the object now (when the simulation were running), and the same problem occurred. When reporting, should I just describe the problem (like above)? Or do you need the code and the simulation-world?

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 07/08/2020 08:44:06
A very simple simulation world + controller would be nice.

Is there a way to get a list of solids within a given volume? or within a range from a point?

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 07/08/2020 09:07:48
Unfortunately not, you have to get all of them and then check the distance manually to the point.

##### oroulet 07/08/2020 09:08:58
OK . that is what we do now. Thanks

You're welcome

##### oroulet 07/08/2020 11:05:23
just to make sure I understand clearly the way webots work:  Every call to the webots API is not threadsafe and must be done in that big loop:



          while supervisor.step(self.time\_step) != -1:

                # do something

##### Stefania Pedrazzi [cyberbotics] 07/08/2020 11:09:50
`@oroulet` the `supervisor.step` function makes the simulation (physics computation, rendering, sensor measurements etc.) to run for the specified time step. If you don't call it regularly, then the simulation doesn't run.


About threadsafe properties, here are some additional documentation:

Hi `@George`! I've been struggling a bit with PyCharm aswell. One of the thing I keep forgetting is to create a new project (and thereby a virtual environment) in PyCharm, after I have used Webots' "Wizard" to create a new controller. Have you created one?

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 07/08/2020 11:27:31
you dont need to create a new controller inside webots. Simply select 'extern' as the controller

##### Stefania Pedrazzi [cyberbotics] 07/08/2020 11:27:36
yes, PYTHONPATH should also contain `${WEBOTS_HOME}\lib\controller\python37`

##### GeoCSBI 07/08/2020 11:29:04
`@EPIC` I didnt create a new virtual environment, i followed `@Simon Steinmann` way, set controller to extern

##### EPIC 07/08/2020 11:29:10
True `@Simon Steinmann`, but to set up the controller to use externally, it's nice to get a default set-up by Webots (by using their Wizard) üôÇ

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 07/08/2020 11:29:59
ah okay, know what you mean


Just set your paths like I posted above and it shoulud work.

 export WEBOTS\_HOME='/usr/local/webots' 

you might have to change, depending on your install

##### Stefania Pedrazzi [cyberbotics] 07/08/2020 11:31:25
Here is the documentation for extern controllers:

[https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/running-extern-robot-controllers?tab-language=python](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/running-extern-robot-controllers?tab-language=python)

##### GeoCSBI 07/08/2020 11:31:51
even if i had done something wrong on the webots side, shouldn't Pycharm run the code? I will try and re-modify the paths

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 07/08/2020 11:32:45
If your paths are correct and you import the controller in pycharm, you set the controller to extern in webots, then you should be able to run the controller inside pycharm

##### EPIC 07/08/2020 11:34:17
I remember I got the same errors as `@GeoCSBI`, regarding the DLL load. My controller itself found the files it needed. But when the controller imports "controller.py", "controller.py" again tried to import "\_controller.py" or something. And I somehow had only given the files in my project access to what I needed, and not other files like "controller.py".. (Atleast that's what I think was happening)

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 07/08/2020 11:34:19
The start of your controller in your own IDE should look something like this:



from controller import Supervisor



robot = Supervisor()

timestep = int(robot.getBasicTimeStep())

My first question is that how one can decide on which properties in the ImmersionProperties are best to be defined.  I can see in the case of Salamander PROTO, there are some instances of dragForceCoefficients but not any case of dragTorqueCoefficients and just one instance of viscousResistanceTorqueCoefficient but not any of viscousResistanceForceCoefficient.

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 07/08/2020 13:20:59
Hi `@Reza`~~ sure, what is your question?~~

##### Reza 07/08/2020 13:21:51
My second question is that can we highlight in anyway the parts of the PROTO node for which the properties are being defined


In webots simulation window I mean so we can see which part is referring to since the names can be confusing sometimes

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 07/08/2020 13:25:50

I can see in the case of Salamander PROTO, there are some instances of dragForceCoefficients but not any case of dragTorqueCoefficients and just one instance of viscousResistanceTorqueCoefficient but not any of viscousResistanceForceCoefficient.

`@Reza` to my knowledge they have been choosen empirically to have a realistic motion of the salamender.


To check which part is selected, the simplest solution is to convert the PROTO node to base node (right click on the node in the scene-tree).

Then select the root salamander node in the Webots scene-tree and then select a part of the salamander in the 3D view, this part will then be auto-selected in the Webots scene-tree.

##### Reza 07/08/2020 13:38:53

##### Stefania Pedrazzi [cyberbotics] 07/08/2020 14:22:23
`@GeoCSBI` note that the default MultiSenseS21 device name is `MultiSense S21` (with a space before S21)

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 07/08/2020 14:22:54
> `@David Mansolino` Thank you! I have already check it, I am having a hard time though to get it (sorry if this is a trivial question but I am fairly new with webots). I am trying to get the device from a Pedestrian(Supervisor) class -> self.getDevice("MultiSenseS21") but it returns None. I think I am messing up the tag but it is somewhat confusing. What tag am I supposed to use to get the object?

`@GeoCSBI` the issues in your code are:

You should never use the `getDevice` in python, but rather `getCamera`, `getRangeFinder` etc. I would recommend following this tutorial in Python: [https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/tutorial-4-more-about-controllers?tab-language=python](https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/tutorial-4-more-about-controllers?tab-language=python)


then the names of the devices are documented here (not simply `MultiSenseS21`) as this PROTO contains several internal Webots devices:

[https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/camera-sensors#internal-devices-names](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/camera-sensors#internal-devices-names)

##### GeoCSBI 07/08/2020 14:31:22
`@David Mansolino` A little note, in the documentation the names are in the form of "MultiSenseS21.name some device", the correct names that I was able to retrieve the devices by name was "MultiSense S21 some device".  I understand that by MultiSenseS21.name implies the name-field of MultiSenseS21  but it was somewhat confusing till I figured it out.

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 07/08/2020 14:36:27
I agree this is not 100% clear, we will tr to improve this.

##### Rajesh Roy 07/09/2020 04:25:00
Hey,

In Webots, one can write Python code to simulate and run the objects present inside the simulation. If I try to export my Webots project into HTML WebGL simulation how should I execute the Python script then?

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 07/09/2020 05:37:08
The controller is executed on the Webots side before exportation, then the motion is recorded in the animation.

If you want to be able to change the controller in the web interface (similar to what is done at: [https://robotbenchmark.net/](https://robotbenchmark.net/), by the way the source code of this site is available at: [https://robotbenchmark.net/](https://robotbenchmark.net/)robotbenchmark.zip) you need to setup a simulation streaming server:

##### Andrei 07/09/2020 06:21:25
hello. In a rectangle arena can I add a very thin square that can be read in supervisor and used as goal for robot? how can I change robot's goal without changing code or adding random to code?

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 07/09/2020 06:23:04
Hi, an you explain a bit more about your square?

Should it a be simply a texture on the floor or should it be a phyical 3D object with physics enabled?

##### Andrei 07/09/2020 06:23:29
texture in best

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 07/09/2020 06:24:15
Ok then I would suggest following the tutorials as this is clearly explaine in the tutorials, in particular this one: [https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/tutorial-3-appearance](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/tutorial-3-appearance)

##### Andrei 07/09/2020 06:24:41
as long as I can def it and read it's position in supervisor, also drag it when I wanna change goal it's perfect

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 07/09/2020 06:26:01
If you want to be able to easily change and read its position, then the simplest solution is to add a simple rectangular 2D shape ([https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/tutorial-2-modification-of-the-environment](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/tutorial-2-modification-of-the-environment)).

##### Andrei 07/09/2020 06:27:27
ya, I added lots of rectangular obstacles.


I guess I should have thought that a solid can be left passable and with really low height it can be used as a goal designation

##### oroulet 07/09/2020 06:59:18
I am getting that message quite often right after  restarting the robot controller. What is the reason? and Is there a way to avoid it? some better cleanup?

to make it work again we need to reset simulation and then start controller again

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 07/09/2020 07:41:47
This may indicate that you robot controller did not exited cleanly (e.g. by calling wb\_robot\_cleanup in C, or destructing the Robot instance in OO languages), then Webots is not aware that the controller closed and think that there is no free 'extern' controller.

##### EPIC 07/09/2020 07:45:25
I have the same issue in Python, when I stop the the python-script (and not the simulation)

##### oroulet 07/09/2020 07:45:34
ummm , We are using python and just closing the script. I would have expected the cleanup to happen automatically... Maybe ctrl-C kills something before clenaup....

Is there a way to force cleanup from python?

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 07/09/2020 07:46:43
Yes that's probably the reason, the kill just stop the script and does not call the 'Robot destructor', one possible way would be to catch the kil signal in your controller and delte the Robot instance and then quit

##### EPIC 07/09/2020 07:47:50
Should one use "simulationQuit()" or "simulationReset()" in that case?

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 07/09/2020 07:49:25
None of them, this is to close Webot, you just want to close cleanly the controller. just something like:

```Python
del robot
sys.exit()
```

##### oroulet 07/09/2020 07:50:37
OK so that is the `__del__` method that has the code for cleaning up. I will try to test as soon as I get two minutes

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 07/09/2020 07:51:09
yes exactly, that's the key point

##### oroulet 07/09/2020 07:53:20
As far as I know that code is supposed to be called anyway. You cannot catch it or avoid it when closing a script. The only issue is that you do not have control of WHEN it is called. So maybe it gets called AFTER the connection to webots is closed or something similar

Might be an issue in wrapper here

##### ContrastNull 07/09/2020 08:05:07
Is there any way to move an object, say a table, with an oceanic movement (technically, 'sea state level 3 movement') ?

I tried using a hinge2Joint and setting its minPosition and maxPosition, but after it reaches the limits, it stops. If it could somehow retrace its path backwards, will do the work.

##### oroulet 07/09/2020 08:06:52
interesting. 

```
try:
    supervisor.plc_run_simulation(plc)
except (KeyboardInterrupt, BaseException):
    print("!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!EXCPET CATCH!!!!!!!!!!!!")
    del plc
    del supervisor
    sys.exit(1) 
```



that kind of code allows reconnection after ctrl-c but triggers every time another issue we have had a few times before: RangeFinder.get\_range\_image() returns None... so the exit is still not clean enough..

Also generally I do not think it is a good idea to have a sys.exit() under a try catch,...

##### Stefania Pedrazzi [cyberbotics] 07/09/2020 08:08:21
`@ContrastNull` yes, you can implement any movement from a controller. In the controller you should check the joint position and when it is close to the limits switch the motion direction

##### oroulet 07/09/2020 08:08:23
everything else seems to work. It is only the RangeFinder that breajs...

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 07/09/2020 08:09:39
> everything else seems to work. It is only the RangeFinder that breajs...

`@oroulet` the range-finder issue is a bug we fixed very recently in our development environment: [https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots/pull/1858](https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots/pull/1858)

You can get a beta of R2020b containing the fix here: [https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots/releases](https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots/releases)


If you try with R2020b let us know if this fixes the issue or not.

##### oroulet 07/09/2020 08:23:06
thanks `@David Mansolino` We will check that

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 07/09/2020 08:23:15
You're welcome

##### oroulet 07/09/2020 08:25:58
btw we are looking at webots to replace gazebo for robot simulation (we wanted something we could run without physicsc but with collilsion) and so far this looks very promissing. Much easier to install, better control over dependencies, more flexible architecture and less buggy. Great work!

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 07/09/2020 08:26:26
Thank you üôÇ

##### EPIC 07/09/2020 09:31:14
Hi! I see that one can enable and disable boundingObject when writing the PROTO with enableBoundingObject (True/False). Is the boolean value automatically connected to the boundingObject? Or do I have to write some code inside the PROTO?


Sorry. I found some example-code from the E-puck, where the code is written. I'll assume that's the way to do it üôÇ

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 07/09/2020 09:40:28
Yes exactly, if you write your own PROTO you have to do it, but this is quite simple, here is a simple example: [https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots/blob/74c086292a96bc0d372480e440de2fc56dc3a50e/projects/objects/buildings/protos/SimpleTwoFloorsHouse.proto#L263-L285](https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots/blob/74c086292a96bc0d372480e440de2fc56dc3a50e/projects/objects/buildings/protos/SimpleTwoFloorsHouse.proto#L263-L285)

##### EPIC 07/09/2020 09:42:18
And I can still set the node to static right? Is it when a node depends on other variables/arguments one should not set it as static?

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 07/09/2020 09:43:13
Yes sure, you should remove the static only when you use a random part in your PROTO (which is a very rare case).

##### EPIC 07/09/2020 09:44:08
Ah, I see. Nice, thank you! üòÅ

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 07/09/2020 09:44:15
You're welcome

##### EPIC 07/09/2020 09:58:42
About the contact properties: Is it possible (in the PROTO) to make the node return a value/bool when another bounding object intersects with it? And then read the value with supervisor?


Or even better, send the value (or it's own DEF/ID) directly to supervisor

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 07/09/2020 10:24:34
The first solution is not possible. But you can:

  - use a touchesensor to detect collision.

  - define a DEF for the Solid in the PROTO file and get it with the new `wb_supervisor_node_get_from_proto_def` function (only available in th ebeta of R2020b: [https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots/releases](https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots/releases)):

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 07/09/2020 11:43:01
How can I get a nodehandle to 'worldinfo' without using DEF?

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 07/09/2020 12:00:48
One solution would be to:


1. get the root node handle (which is a hidden Group node)

2. loop through the nodes in its children field

3. check the type of each node in the children field.

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 07/09/2020 12:03:11
can you give me a code snippet for '2.'?

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 07/09/2020 12:03:29
Sure, which language?

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 07/09/2020 12:03:33
python

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 07/09/2020 12:06:41
Here is an (untested) example:

```Python
root_children_field = supervisor.getRoot().getField('children')
for i in range(root_children_field.getCount()):
    node = root_children_field.getMFNode(i)
    if node.getType() == Node.WORLD_INFO:
        pass  # do something with the node
```

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 07/09/2020 12:07:19
thanks so much üôÇ

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 07/09/2020 12:07:25
You're welcome

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 07/09/2020 12:08:15
as Worldinfo is always on top, would this work?

root\_children\_field.getMFNode(0)

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 07/09/2020 12:09:14
Yes, this is less generic but in the Worldinfo case this should indeed work perfectly too

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 07/09/2020 12:10:02
Alright, thank you, will make benchmark automation much easier üôÇ


quick question, given a small enough timestep, it should not matter if I reload the world or just reset the simulation between runs right?


or are there some things that might need to be considered?

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 07/09/2020 12:12:59
the behavior is not exactly the same, the advantage of the reset are:

  - Much faster

  - The controller keeps running

And on the other side reload, make sure you are starting from a completely clean environment (like if you had close and re-open Webots).

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 07/09/2020 12:13:26
which aspects might not be 'clean'


with a reset

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 07/09/2020 12:14:37
For example node removed during the simulation are not re-inserted.

Here is the complete list of what a reset does:

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 07/09/2020 12:16:25
I'm talkinig about the supervisor function simulationReset, which doesnt restart the controller. But If I dont create or delete any nodes, I should be good?

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 07/09/2020 12:18:35
The simulationReset from the supervisor is performing the exact same action than the one from the user interface (except that the controller are not restarted).

But yes, except deleted node it should behave the same.

Hey there, i'm running into an issue using R2020a rev1 and python. 



I am importing a .wbo node which is just a default light sensor i exported earlier, into the children of supervisor robot node.  I am then trying to get a handle to the light sensor device by using the getLightSensor() method, but it returns a warning that it is not found. I even tried delaying several steps between importing the light sensor and calling getLightSensor. 



Is there something i'm missing? I have a simple project reproducing the issue, i can share it if needed.

##### oroulet 07/09/2020 18:04:36
`@David Mansolino` 2020b did not solve the issue of get\_range\_image() returning None sometimes after startup in python   

Also adding `del robot` and `del supervisor` do not in fact change the behaviour, we still often an error message after closing the python controlle with ctrl-c.

So there is something else going on here... we have threads but are carefull to only call webot from main thread and I remember that early rototypes without threads also had that issue. must be something with the clenaup of connection...


btw what protocol is used between external controllers and webots? can we wireshark it?

`@Lifebinder (tsampazk)` This is unfortunately not supported, devices imported during the simulation are not available from the controller.

`@oroulet` that strange, once the del robot is called, the connection with webots should be closed. When you do the del, do you see any exit message in Webots?


> btw what protocol is used between external controllers and webots? can we wireshark it?

`@oroulet` Webots uses it's own protocol to communicate with the controller processes (it is exactly the same for normal or 'extern' controllers), it uses pipes (and shared memory for camera images).

As the crash happens randomly (i cannot control when it happens) and i am quite noobie with gdb I don't know how I can get the stack from gdb after the webots crash and shut down.

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 07/10/2020 06:57:39
Once you attached it you can type un gdb 'continue' to let Webots run, then you can use Webots as usual, when it crashed you can go back to gdb and get the stack with 'backtrace'.

After watching a couple of tutorials and reading the documentation, it told me that the best possible way to import my model into webots is via blender. however whenever i install the addon provided in github for importing into blender, it gives an error that "upgrade to 2.8x required" while i'm already using 2.83.2 version of blender. Is there any way to fix it or should i install 2.79 version of blender for which the addon was originally made?

`@DragonBorne` unfortunately, this plugin doesn't support Blender >= 2.8, so for now the only possible solution to use it is to install Blender 2.79.

Alternatively, the beta version of Webots R2020b support import from way more file format (maybe some of them can be exported directly from creo), see ' Import 3D Model...': [https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/the-user-interface?version=develop#file-menu](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/the-user-interface?version=develop#file-menu)

##### Luiz Felipe 07/13/2020 06:05:57
`@David Mansolino` the first 15 steps... (I got 2 crashes, 2 backtraces during the weekend and they are the same...)

we have a physics plugin that uses a mutex, like this: [https://github.com/omichel/test\_world/blob/develop/plugins/physics/collision\_detector/collision\_detector.cpp](https://github.com/omichel/test_world/blob/develop/plugins/physics/collision_detector/collision_detector.cpp)


Do you think the crash is related to the physics plugin or related to calling the step function in webots?

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 07/13/2020 06:52:56
Yes, that might be the reason indeed, the simplest is probably to try runnign your simulation without physics plugin and check if it still crashes.

##### Luiz Felipe 07/13/2020 06:56:32
I will re-run with the collision plugin disabled... what do you mean by "did you enable multithreading of the physics in your simulation?"

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 07/13/2020 06:57:17
Make sure the 'WorldInfo.optimalThreadCount' field is set to 1.

##### Luiz Felipe 07/13/2020 07:00:18
It is already set to 1.

I am running one simulation without the physics plugin and one simulation with the physics plugin (but recompiled with CFLAGS=-g). Both running via gdb. This dWorldStep() function is from the ODE dynamics library right? If I don't have a physics plugin, only call a step() in the supervisor, does this function is still used?

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 07/13/2020 07:49:52
Yes it is called by Webots indeed. So it will be called even if you don't have physics plugin, but since the physics plugin interact with this fucntion, it can be the cause of the crash in this function.

##### Luiz Felipe 07/13/2020 07:58:56
I just got a crash for the one with the physics plugin (recompiled with CFLAGS=-g). Visually I see that one of the 10 robots disappeared from the screen. Only 9 are visible... Regarding the backtrace, I got the same backtrace I sent you once again (3 times i get the same backtrace). Nothing related to the functions contained in the collision\_detector.cpp file (e.g. webots\_physics\_step(), webots\_physics\_collide())...


It seems that after a collision, the robot is sent to a position so far in the space that it crashes the webots physics dynamics library. Now I can reproduce the error selecting a robot and grabbing it really far from the field.

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 07/13/2020 08:05:37
that can indeed be a good explanation. In that case you should make sure that they do not 'explode', you can try improvign the boundign objects, make sure that if you 'teleport' the robot you don't overlap them, etc.

##### Luiz Felipe 07/13/2020 08:07:48
When relocating we already are treating to not overlap them... But in the case of the robot 'exploding' after a collision, what can i change to avoid that (in addition to improve the bounding objects -> regarding improving the bounding objects would be simplifying them?)

`@oroulet` because the step is makeing Webots run and therefore perform rendering, it is probably not your controller, but Webots that is using this GPU.

##### oroulet 07/13/2020 08:26:54
yes it is webots. OK if you says it is normal . We trust you ;-). although when nothing happens I would have expected some optimization

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 07/13/2020 08:28:12
A rendering is performs in any case at each step, but you can reduce this from the `Viewpoint.FPS` field ([https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/worldinfo](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/worldinfo)) or usign the fast mode.

##### oroulet 07/13/2020 08:28:13
also ctrl-c on that loop kills the interpreter.. .. I am not sure this is correct behaviour... Although this a common issue with C wrappers...

yes, thanks for the prompt response

##### Stefania Pedrazzi [cyberbotics] 07/13/2020 14:56:08
You did not set the DEF name. "Sojourner" is the node name not the DEF name.


To set the DEF name you have to select the node and write the DEF name in the field editor


In this tutorial it is explained how to set the DEF name: [https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/tutorial-2-modification-of-the-environment#def-use-mechanism](https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/tutorial-2-modification-of-the-environment#def-use-mechanism)

all I did was change the DEF name as you suggested


Even though I m not getting an error anymore, Im not sure if the simulation is functioning properly... Would you have any suggestions as to why the robot moves about 1 m but gets stuck? 

When I m not running the supervisor, the robot runs the course without problems

##### Stefania Pedrazzi [cyberbotics] 07/13/2020 15:10:12
It depends on what you are doing with the Supervisor API, but if you do not modify the world then it should run exactly as before adding the Supervisor API instructions

##### Clara Cardoso Ferreira 07/13/2020 15:16:01
the simulation never runs the for loopüßê


[https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/supervisor-programming?tab-language=c](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/supervisor-programming?tab-language=c)


Im curious as to how I can get the code I copied  from the supervisor documentation to run as expected.

##### Stefania Pedrazzi [cyberbotics] 07/13/2020 15:26:35
The problem is probably the integration of the sample code with your already existing controller code.

You should inspect step by step what is the resulting controller doing, which are the differences from the previous controller and where does the issue come from.


If you copy one to one the sample controller and set the robot DEF name, then the sample controller works as expected.

##### Clara Cardoso Ferreira 07/13/2020 16:02:57
Yeah, that's my strategy. It seems like it ran... i just had to wait a minute for the code to finish. I still dont know why the robot gets stuck, but Ill play around with the code a little longer. Thanks

##### hp 07/13/2020 16:20:21
Hello, I was wondering if there was an easy way to translate the soccer demo (which is written in C) into python. I am trying manually and I am having a hard time using the Receiver correctly..


To specify, I would like to leave the Supervisor untouched (that means in C) and only translate the players to python. That means, I need to find the right 'decode' parameters so that the python receiver can understand the C emitter. At the moment, my code for this looks like this: message=receiver.getData().decode('utf-8')


But this gives me the following error: UnicodeDecodeError: 'utf-8' codec can't decode byte 0xd9 in position 8: invalid continuation byte

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 07/14/2020 05:53:31
Hi `@hp`, since the supervisor is sending a struct ([https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots/blob/master/projects/robots/softbank/nao/controllers/nao\_soccer\_supervisor/RoboCupGameControlData.h#L76](https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots/blob/master/projects/robots/softbank/nao/controllers/nao_soccer_supervisor/RoboCupGameControlData.h#L76)) I would try in Python to read it with the `struct` module ([https://docs.python.org/3/library/struct.html](https://docs.python.org/3/library/struct.html)).

##### hp 07/14/2020 06:55:33
Thanks a lot, that helped! This code works:

##### estrada 07/14/2020 11:20:08
Hello. I am wrapping a fairly complicated robot model into a self-contained PROTO node.  The file I've inherited relies on several, custom-defined shape definitions. These are all currently defined in the Webots world file but not within the robot node itself. Is there a way to encapsulate these custom shapes into the `.PROTO` node, or would best practice be to somehow define each of these shapes as another self-contained unit (e.g. objects?) and reference those?

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 07/14/2020 11:22:04
Hi, it depends, if you will use these shapes only from the PROTO file (and only from a single one) it is simpler to add them in the PROTO file, if you need to use them from elsewhere of the PROTO it is better to define sub-PROTO nodes.

##### estrada 07/14/2020 11:31:21
Thanks `@David Mansolino` ! It is only references from the PROTO file . Is there an example or documentation on where such definitions should go? I've tried defining these before the robot definition but it didn't seem to work correctly. E.g. : 



```
PROTO MyRobot[
    ...
]
{
  DEF MY_SHAPE1 Shape { 
    ...
  } 

  Robot {
  ... USE MY_SHAPE1 
  }
} 
```



If this is the correct placement, I still haven't done the due diligence to debug the node. My first doubt was whether this was even close to best practice in Webots.

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 07/14/2020 11:32:50
here is how ti should looks like:

```
PROTO MyRobot[
    ...
]
{
  Robot {
    children [
      DEF MY_SHAPE1 Shape { 
        ...
      }
      ...
    ]
  }
}
```

##### estrada 07/14/2020 11:37:45
Ok, duly noted. I assume it's not possible to define shapes outside of other nodes? 



I notice the file I've received is initially defining these shapes in Transform nodes above the main Robot node. It would be useful to define these somewhere slightly separated from the main lines of the  robot model-- the volumes are custom points (I assume generated from CAD) that are horribly long.

having a multipurpose/universal trajectory follower controller would be a great addition to webots. It would allow easy integration with moveit. Seeing as most robotic arm manufacturers provide all the configs already, That would be a huge value add

Question about physics node. In the case of a robotic arm where each segment has a physics node with a specified mass. What will be the effect of specifying the mass of the robot node?



1. The overall mass of the robot will be the one specified in the robot node?

2. The overall mass of the robot will be the sum of all the different mass?

3. The mass affect only objects specified inside boundingObjects node?



Thank you and I hope that I am understandable enough. I did not find the answer in the documentation.

`@David Mansolino` Ok, I did it like that. (But I was actually talking about the demo soccer simulation: webots/projects/samples/demos/controllers/soccer\_referee\_supervisor )

##### Luiz Felipe 07/16/2020 06:08:55
`@David Mansolino` I thought that I solved the instability in my simulation, but explosions after collisions still happen. I find that is probably caused by CFM and ERP values, but that is really hard to debug and solve it. Crashes are really critical for my application that is going to run for a long time or in real time. I am in doubt how to tune the CFM, soft CFM values, because in the "My Robot/Simulation Explodes, What should I do?" section it tells me to increase the CFM:



%figure
![unknown.png](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/565154703139405824/733203567275540611/unknown.png)
%end


About the softCFM then, it tells me to reduce the value:



%figure
![unknown.png](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/565154703139405824/733203696501915688/unknown.png)
%end

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 07/16/2020 06:12:14
About the CFM, increasing the CFM will decrease the constraints on the physics. Therefore, increasing the CFM will decrease the system precision but increase its staibility.

##### Luiz Felipe 07/16/2020 06:23:14
Yups. However, the softCFM in the contact properties should be reduced? As stated in "My Robot Sinks into the Ground, How to Remove this effect"... or this just applies to really heavy robots?

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 07/16/2020 06:53:39
This is indeed for heavy robots

##### Luiz Felipe 07/16/2020 10:34:57
> This is indeed for heavy robots

`@David Mansolino` To reduce this value would not make the simulation more unstable also?

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 07/16/2020 10:35:41
Yes:

> Therefore, increasing the CFM will decrease the system precision but increase its staibility.

##### Luiz Felipe 07/16/2020 10:39:41
I think maybe I am misunderstanding the softCFM value. Increasing the CFM I understand.

And then

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 07/16/2020 10:40:06
Yes, to increase the stability you should increase the CFM

##### Luiz Felipe 07/16/2020 10:40:17

"My robot/simulation explodes" and "My robot sinks to the ground"

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 07/16/2020 10:48:03
The doces seems correct, increasign the CFM will make the contact more spingy and therefore improve the stability, however the robot make therefore sink a bit in the floor.

##### Luiz Felipe 07/16/2020 10:49:02
Ah ok... now i got it... the robot sinks into the ground but it is not a crash


i tought it also resulted in a crash this situation

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 07/16/2020 10:50:00
Exactly, allowing the robot to sink a bit in the floor make the simulation stabler.

##### Luiz Felipe 07/16/2020 10:52:19
"The explosion is usually caused by inappropriate values passed to the physics engine (ODE)." Any tip on how to find which values are the inappropriate ones leading to crashes?

Ok, in that case, the `ActionServerNode` class inherits from the `WebotsNode` one, which inherits from the `Node` one from rclpy.node.

As described in the documentation of rclpy ([http://docs.ros2.org/foxy/api/rclpy/api/node.html](http://docs.ros2.org/foxy/api/rclpy/api/node.html)) the first argument is the name of the node.

I am trying to connect PyCharm with webots, I think I did everything in those papers (using windown rn)

I have whole PATH in environment variables in PyCharm configuration my code is something like this:

*imports* 



print(sys.version)

--blah blah--

while robot.step(timestep) != -1:

   --- blah blah ---



It gives me error right away 

 File "C:/DP\_Webots/controllers/contr/contr.py", line 70

    while robot.step(timestep) != -1:

`@Laojiang` unfortunately, the Webots Python API supports only the standard version of Python by default.

I would like to have the default position when adding the robot, to be its home position


because all joints at 0, is an invalid state


looks like that

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 07/20/2020 10:21:35
What you did should work, let me try

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 07/20/2020 10:22:03
this is the proto in question
> **Attachment**: [J2n6s300.proto](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/565154703139405824/734716747684511764/J2n6s300.proto)


it has also a issue with the "j2n6s300\_end\_effector" not having a inertia matrix. As it is only a virtual link I think. Also the hand shape doesn't cast a shadow

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 07/20/2020 10:30:54
I just tested, you are right, this is working when editing the rotation field from the scene-tree because the rotation of the endpoint Solid is automatically updated, but not when manually editing the PROTO file (in that case you need to manually rotate the Solid).

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 07/20/2020 10:31:43
But that would alter what a pose with specific joint values would look like right?

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 07/20/2020 10:32:30
No if you change both the position of the joint and rotation of the Solid, then the matching will remains untouched

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 07/20/2020 10:33:06
but the position of the motors is 0, even when I specify otherwise

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 07/20/2020 10:33:24
Where do you see this?

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 07/20/2020 10:34:10

%figure
![unknown.png](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/565154703139405824/734719798767779860/unknown.png)
%end

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 07/20/2020 10:35:09
This indicates the latest target position, but not the actual curent position of the joint, for this you need to look at the position sensors.

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 07/20/2020 10:36:22
they show 0 as well. but they probably updated to the target values of 0


but the question is, why is the target position 0?

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 07/20/2020 10:37:11
Because this is the default target position since you did not call wb\_motor\_set\_position.

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 07/20/2020 10:38:30
this only happens with the void controller?

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 07/20/2020 10:41:15
This happens with any controller not calling the `wb_motor_set_position` function.

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 07/20/2020 10:45:12
So if I dont call the function at all? my robot will always collapse? Going to 0


would be nice if it would go to the position defined in the proto file, which is 0, if not explicitly specified

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 07/20/2020 10:46:32
No you should not have to call it, what I am trying to say is that you should not rely on the value display in the 'motor' tab of the robot window to know the current angle, but rather to the position sensor one.

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 07/20/2020 10:49:54
hmm okay, I'll try to get behind that part later. For now, I wanna figure out the correct proto settings though



%figure
![unknown.png](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/565154703139405824/734723866232094830/unknown.png)
%end


so here I add the position of the hinge joint to the rotation of the endPoint Solid? (marked)


I guess in this case I will have to define the axis too

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 07/20/2020 10:52:46
Yes this is the rotation you have to change (and define the axis, otherwise the rotation will have no effect).

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 07/20/2020 10:58:53
oh god, this model is truly ugly. it needs rotations around several axis.


I think I give up. Getting that starting position to work is too much of a headache. I can still create a PR for the proto. It seems correct and can probably be worked with, if one disables SelfCollision (added a field for that), moves it to the correct pose and saves the world file


but it also has the issue of no shadow for the hand (converting to base nodes, the shapes seem to be correct and CastShadow field is set to TRUE)

![unknown.png](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/565154703139405824/734727439296626758/unknown.png)
%end

##### Stefania Pedrazzi [cyberbotics] 07/20/2020 11:04:55
a simpler solution than computing the new `endPoint` translation and rotation manually is to convert the PROTO to base nodes and change the `position` field so that the endPoint will be automatically updated


then you simply have to copy the `endPoint` Solid translation and rotation values in your PROTO file

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 07/20/2020 11:06:14
okay, I'll give it a shot... last try though üòÑ


uh I think that is the answer

##### Stefania Pedrazzi [cyberbotics] 07/20/2020 11:20:13
about the shadows issue, is the object semi-transparent? because this could be a reason why shadows cannot be displayed

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 07/20/2020 11:20:32
transparency is set to 0


this is the shape in question, colored it red as a check, no changes otherwise

##### Stefania Pedrazzi [cyberbotics] 07/20/2020 11:38:36
For this particular IndexedFaceSet the shadows are not displayed because it has too many vertices. If you want to get the shadow, then you should simplify the mesh

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 07/20/2020 11:39:19
ah okay... well I can live with it üòÑ

webots throws an error that the solid doesnt have an inertia matrix


as it is just a virtual link, how should I deal with it? convert it to a transform?

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 07/20/2020 11:42:42
Yes, or a Solid without bounding object or physics. But probably you even don't need it?

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 07/20/2020 11:43:19
most likely not, but someone converting their project from gazebo to webots might

Final issue, the joints for the fingers rotate around the wrong axis. The screenshot also shows the urdf definition. One can see that the translation of the hingeJoint is correct. The rotation seems correct as well, as the in position = 0, the finger is placed correctly. However it does not rotate around its own z-axis like it should

I'm guessing that anchor and axis of the Hingejoint has to be changed, but I have no clue on how to do that correctly.  Here I find the urdf way of doing it much more intuitive. Defining translation and rotation AND then the axis in that new frame

How to slove the problem that click "reset simulation" webots shut down caused by the overly complex model?

##### Stefania Pedrazzi [cyberbotics] 07/20/2020 12:15:01
`@Laojiang` did you try to simplify your model as much as possible but keeping the issue?

We can help you only if you share your model because we cannot reproduce it with the built-in models distributed in Webots.

I would suggest you to open an issue on the GitHub repo where you upload the project files and you describe your issue.: [https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots/issues/new/choose](https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots/issues/new/choose)

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 07/20/2020 12:29:49
hmm I manually calculated the axis, and the values should be correct... but for some reason, the joint is rotating incorrectly

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 07/20/2020 12:31:47
I installed the latest fixes for the converter, which fixed the issues for me


it's not that it rotates the wrong direction, It doesnt rotate on the correct axis at all


how can I tell webots to use the z-axis of the endpoint to use as the rotational axis for the hinge joint?
%figure
![unknown.png](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/565154703139405824/734758139206959144/unknown.png)
%end


okay I have found the issue


[https://www.andre-gaschler.com/rotationconverter/](https://www.andre-gaschler.com/rotationconverter/)


if you use this tool and enter the Euler angles from the urdf files you get this:
%figure
![unknown.png](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/565154703139405824/734761351729119252/unknown.png)
%end


as we are rotating around the z-axis, we multiply by [0 0 1] vector (vertical) and we get the last column as our hing joing axis


This is what webots does as well. This however gives us a wrong axis


now if we enter the axis angles, that webots calculated for the enpoint like so:
%figure
![unknown.png](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/565154703139405824/734761867838488677/unknown.png)
%end


We get this matrix. And entering the last column as our hingeJoint axis, finally gives the correct behavior
%figure
![unknown.png](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/565154703139405824/734762026898817084/unknown.png)
%end


webots seems to do something different with the Euler angles. If I convert the urdf euler angles to the axis angles, I get a different result. If I put these into webots, the finger is oriented wrongly. So webots seems to do that conversion correctly.


The strange thing is, this has only been an issue for these 3 fingers. The rest works fine. It might be worth to investigate though


I created a PR with the jaco2 proto. It works now, only thing is the missing shadow

Hi guys, I am having an issue with controlling the speed of the truck (using Truck.proto). In the practical test, our real vehicle needs to have continuous throttle values to reach and maintain a desired speed. In Webots simulations, we notice that the truck only needs a few throttle values and it will run forever. I wonder if I miss some settings on the road or the truck (for example, tire-road friction). Please kindly advise me. Thank you.

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 07/21/2020 05:59:30
Hi `@John520`, the throttle of the car was unfortunately not calibrated agains a real vehicle.


For this, the `engineFunctionCoefficients` and `gearRatio` fields of the truc should be calibrated ([https://cyberbotics.com/doc/automobile/car](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/automobile/car)).

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 07/21/2020 11:13:20
You can use a Group node or a Transform node to put them together.

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 07/21/2020 15:29:17
Yes, you should get the CameraRecognitionObject from a Camera device.


Using the getRecognitionObjects() method.

Hello , I need some help in understanding the processes involved in simulating my robot . I'm a complete newbie to Webots , so please go easy on me . So I've created my bot on Solidworks , then converted it to .vrml97 format to import it to  Webots .  Now When I went through the website , I saw that one can simulate sensors like Kinect , Gyroscope and Accelerometer and also motors on Webots. This is the  part where I am having trouble with .  My bot is a stair climber which uses the above mentioned sensors and of course motors  to climb. How can I incorporate those sensors and motors into my robot in order to simulate the process? . If possible , please provide suitable links which cover this part in detail. Thanks !

##### Zerfallskonstante 07/21/2020 17:59:05

I have multiple solids. I will do a single solid box (for wbo) by using all of them.

##### Stefania Pedrazzi [cyberbotics] 07/22/2020 05:59:21
`@chenpixx` Yes, it is correct to put all of them in the children field of a parent container node. But if your solid box is not a robot but just an object, then it is better to use:

* `Solid` node for dynamic objects (with physics properties)

* `Transform` node for static objects (pure graphical objects)


`@Zerfallskonstante` unfortunately it is not possible to change the shortcuts from the UI. But we already fixed this and in the latest version of Webots and changed the shortcut.


Which version are you using?


Actually it is just the tooltip that is wrong. The shortcut is CTRL+SHIFT+T (T instead of F)

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 07/22/2020 06:09:14
`@Laojiang`: now that you have the list of CameraRecognitionObject, you can use the specific methods of this object, e.g., get\_id(), get\_position(), etc., see details here: [https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/camera?tab-language=python#wb\_camera\_recognition\_get\_objects](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/camera?tab-language=python#wb_camera_recognition_get_objects)

Are there any simulation data from controllers stored somewhere?


When I run my program, it reserves by default (unchangably) almost 3GB of GPU memory. So maybe there is problem it runs out of memory after this time if some from webots are stored into it

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 07/22/2020 08:46:04
Yes, it could be a problem. You should compare the footprint of your controller program with a simple python controller program to better understand the problem.

Is there such a way?

##### Stefania Pedrazzi [cyberbotics] 07/22/2020 09:21:05
`@watchdogs132` if you import from VRML format, then you have to adjust all the Transform nodes and convert them to the appropriate Robot, Solid, etc. and basically rebuild the robot structure manually keeping just the translation/rotation of parts and the meshes.

An alternative is to use this converter: [https://github.com/cyberbotics/blender-webots-exporter](https://github.com/cyberbotics/blender-webots-exporter)


You should import your model in blender instead of converting it to VRML and use the converter to generate directly the Webots model.


`@Laojiang` no there is no other way to set variables available on all the controllers.

If you don't want to use IP methods as I suggested before to shared data between the controllers ((note that it is quite easy to use the Emitter/Receiver method) and the variable is simply a string or int or simple data, you could set it for example in the `Robot.customData` field and read it in the other robot controller using the Supervisor API

`@watchdogs132` 

I used that converter to import meshes and then I built my robot by adding one mesh after another. 

However, I need to do some little more work on it, as it sometimes gives me error that my mass of robot is set to 1 due to some error in proto file

Which Webots version are you using?

Did you save and revert your world after adding the gripper?

##### culurciello 07/22/2020 14:38:34

This seems a problem of your controller program that requires an invalid position to the gripper motor.

About your world, you didn't send the controller. But I moved the arm using the robot window (double click on the robot and then move the joints using the sliders) and it works correctly.

##### watchdogs132 07/23/2020 07:14:58
Thank you for your reply , but since I am completely new to Webots , before I report this , I just want to make sure that I didn't mess anything up . Here's a step by step of what I did .

Created a world -> Added a Robot node -> Child node-> Added a camera node .

I created a controller cpp file .

Here's the code :

 #include <webots/Robot.hpp>

\#include <webots/Camera.hpp>

\#define TIME\_STEP 64

using namespace webots;

int main(int argc, char **argv) {

  Robot *robot = new Robot();

  int timeStep = (int)robot->getBasicTimeStep();

  Camera *cm;

  cm=robot->getCamera("camera");

  cm->enable(TIME\_STEP);

  while (robot->step(timeStep) != -1) {

  };

  delete robot;

  return 0;

}

It compiles but the camera window is pitch black .

Hi,

there exist a library named aruco ([https://docs.opencv.org/trunk/d5/dae/tutorial\_aruco\_detection.html](https://docs.opencv.org/trunk/d5/dae/tutorial_aruco_detection.html)), can I simulate similar coordinate systems as described in picture?

Hello, might I ask you something ?

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 07/23/2020 13:29:43
hi, yes sure!

##### Gautier A. 07/23/2020 13:29:51
Hi David, thank you !


So it's just a little question


When I'm opening a world with two camera, I have these two box

![unknown.png](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/565154703139405824/735851245075562506/unknown.png)
%end


Because these camera are only used through Ros, I'm not really interested having the visualizer "open" by default


Is there a way to desactivate it by default ?

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 07/23/2020 13:31:36
You can close them manually using the small cross on the top right of the box. Or disable all of them at once from the 'Overlays' menu.

##### Gautier A. 07/23/2020 13:33:13
Is there a way to do it automitcally when loading the world ?

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 07/23/2020 13:34:24
Unfortunately not, but if you use the 'Overlays' menu, this will be saved for all the world files 'forever'.

##### Gautier A. 07/23/2020 13:35:56
Understood, thank you a lot !

`@GeoCSBI` are you using the `CameraRecognitionObject.get_position_on_image()`  function? If yes, you should be able to use the return value as a simple list.

`@ContrastNull` if you want your controller to run you have to export not the scene, but an animation and let the simulation run: [https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/web-animation](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/web-animation)

If you want to be able to dynamically change the controller from the web scene, then this is a bit more complexe and requires in adition to GitHub pages a web server able to run Webots i nthe background: [https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/web-simulation](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/web-simulation)

##### watchdogs132 07/24/2020 06:18:07
Hello . I have imported my .wrl file to .wbt using Blender ,  my bot shows up accurately on Webot ,with all the nodes as shape . But when I put one of the shape nodes (say the wheel)as the child node of a robot node , ideally I want the axes of the child node to be totally aligned with the wheel but that is not the case. There is a major offset . How can I fix this? . This offset axes problem is with all the shape nodes .

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 07/24/2020 06:23:45
Hi `@watchdogs132`, you have to add a Transform (or Solid) node as children of the robot node, and then put the shape in the children field of this Transform/Solid ndoe.


I would recommend following this tutorial: 

[https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/tutorial-5-compound-solid-and-physics-attributes](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/tutorial-5-compound-solid-and-physics-attributes)

[https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/tutorial-6-4-wheels-robot](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/tutorial-6-4-wheels-robot)

##### watchdogs132 07/24/2020 06:33:54
I did that , but as you can see the axes is still not aligned .

%end

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 07/24/2020 06:34:46
You can align them by changing the `translation` and `rotation` fields of the Transform node.

##### watchdogs132 07/24/2020 06:35:38
When I change that or move the axes with my cursor , the entire wheel moves .


Ideally , I want the intersection of the 3 axis to be aligned with the center of the wheel


When I create a shape in webots , then the axis is totally aligned , but that's not the case with imported objects

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 07/24/2020 06:43:57
> When I change that or move the axes with my cursor , the entire wheel moves .

`@watchdogs132` yes that's normal, that's not what you need?

##### watchdogs132 07/24/2020 07:02:43
`@David Mansolino`  I want that , that's possible in this picture too . But look at the offset ,I want the center of the 3 axis to be at the center of the wheel .

`@Laojiang`   I selected a standart box .

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 07/24/2020 08:47:16
If you add a physics and mass, then the box dynamic is enabled and it therefore falls because of the gravity.

##### chenpixx 07/24/2020 08:47:40
I added physics and mass also.


It falls


D ensiry 1e+3 mass 0.5  but when i selecetd boundaryobject a box it fall down.

The default value are documented here: [https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/motor](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/motor)

They are 10, 0, 0

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 07/24/2020 09:56:56
ah okay. Is there still a way to read them out?

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 07/24/2020 09:57:02
There are unfortunately no way (except using a Supervisor controller) to read them out.

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 07/24/2020 09:57:16
how can I read out the field of a deviceHandle?


(with a supervisor controller)

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 07/24/2020 09:57:51
You can't from the deviceHandle, you have to get the node reference and then get it's field.

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 07/24/2020 09:58:27
and how do I get the nodehandle from a device handle?


I have run into this issue before. That is something that is not very clear


supervisor controller with nodes is awesome and easy to implement. I still havent fully understood device handles and what the difference to nodes is

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 07/24/2020 10:01:40
> and how do I get the nodehandle from a device handle?

`@Simon Steinmann` you can't, you have to use a DEFNAME or something like this, there is no way to link a device handle to its node ref.

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 07/24/2020 10:04:02
converting the robot to basenodes seems easier ^^


but thank you, I can work from here


still, is there a explanation of devicehandles vs nodes? I would like to read up on it and understand it properly

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 07/24/2020 10:09:31
a device handle is to be used with the stadard API, a node ref is a reference to a node in the scene tree (regardless of it beeing a device or not) to be used with the Supervisor API only.

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 07/24/2020 10:15:58
it would be nice to be able to set and get all fields of any device

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 07/24/2020 10:17:20
You can do this from the supervisor.

##### watchdogs132 07/24/2020 10:19:03
> `@David Mansolino`  I want that , that's possible in this picture too . But look at the offset ,I want the center of the 3 axis to be at the center of the wheel .

`@watchdogs132`  As it turns out , the origin wasn't aligned with the object in the solidworks model . Aligning the origin and then importing in Webots did the trick .

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 07/24/2020 10:19:56
but not without major hassle. Would be nice to take your motor handle like:

motor1 = robot.getMotor('motor1')

and then do something like

motor1.getControlPID()

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 07/24/2020 10:22:42
I see.

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 07/24/2020 10:23:28
or having an addition in supervisor like:

node\_get\_from\_device\_handle


that would actually be really nice

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 07/24/2020 10:24:38
Yes, `@David Mansolino` proposed this here: [https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots/issues/1992](https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots/issues/1992). Would that suit your need?

Hello, I was looking at the conditions to make the simulation deterministic ([https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/modeling#how-to-make-replicabledeterministic-simulations](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/modeling#how-to-make-replicabledeterministic-simulations)), regarding the first item (Each simulation must be restarted either by pushing the Reload button, or by using the wb\_supervisor\_world\_reload function, or by restarting Webots), can `wb_supervisor_simulation_reset` be used?

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 07/24/2020 13:00:10
Hi, it is safer to use the `wb_supervisor_world_reload` as this completely recreates the world from scratch, however, in most of the cases the ``wb\_supervisor\_simulation\_reset``function will be enough.

##### mbusy 07/24/2020 13:07:13

Hello !

Are there any ROS standard controller examples using python available for reference ......and also any examples of how to synchronise the simulation with ROS node using - - synchronise argument .

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 07/24/2020 13:37:45
Hi!


Do you want to create a ros node and communicate with the Webots ros standard controller, or write your own Python Webots ROS controller?

##### yash 07/24/2020 13:39:27
Want to create a ROS node with standard ROS  controller

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 07/24/2020 13:40:42
Ok, here is a simple example in that case: [https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots/blob/develop/projects/languages/ros/webots\_ros/scripts/ros\_python.py](https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots/blob/develop/projects/languages/ros/webots_ros/scripts/ros_python.py)

Used together with this launch file:

[https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots/blob/develop/projects/languages/ros/webots\_ros/launch/webots\_ros\_python.launch](https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots/blob/develop/projects/languages/ros/webots_ros/launch/webots_ros_python.launch)

##### yash 07/24/2020 13:42:14
Yes but in this case it‚Äôs an example for custom ROS controller

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 07/24/2020 13:42:48
Oh yes you're right, wrong link


Unfortunately, we have only C++ example of what you want to do.

##### yash 07/24/2020 13:44:08
Yes üòÖ ! That‚Äôs why asked whether if python examples are available for the same

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 07/24/2020 13:44:34
Unfortunately not for ROS1, we have some but only for ROS2

##### yash 07/24/2020 13:44:57
Oh alright !  no problem will figure something out...

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 07/24/2020 14:33:52
`@yash` you can run the c++ roscontroller, but then interact with it through your own python scripts

##### yash 07/24/2020 14:37:10
I didn‚Äôt understand exactly ! If you may elaborate it would be great `@Simon Steinmann`

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 07/24/2020 14:38:29
if you run your simulation with the standard ros controller, every motor and sensor will get it's own topics. You can check these by running 'rostopic list', 'rosnode list' and 'rosservice list'


you can then interact with these through ros


create your own little python script, where you for example change the position of a motor by publishing to the appropiate topic


with ros, every node is independant and can run in either python or c++.

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 07/24/2020 14:40:34
I think what `@yash` is looking for is an example of a ros node written in Python that communicates with the default C++ Webots ROS controller.

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 07/24/2020 14:42:26
`@yash` are you using an example world?

##### yash 07/24/2020 14:44:39
No custom made world


> if you run your simulation with the standard ros controller, every motor and sensor will get it's own topics. You can check these by running 'rostopic list', 'rosnode list' and 'rosservice list'

`@Simon Steinmann`  yes this is what exactly I am doing ....... all the topics and services are already available since I am using the Standard ros controller , But I wanted some similar examples because when the complexity of my code increases I face some issues

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 07/24/2020 14:49:57
I just checked again, and you mainly interact through services. Do you know how to call services from rospy?


1. open terminal and run 'roscore'


2. select ros as conttroller in webots

rospy.init\_node('my\_controller') 



motor1 = rospy.ServiceProxy('/UR10e\_3208\_simon\_Legion\_Y540/shoulder\_pan\_joint/set\_position', set\_float) 

request = set\_floatRequest()

this is the sample code, in case you want to copy it

##### yash 07/24/2020 15:09:35
I am familiar with how to work with ros standard controller by using .......the problem is that when multiple sensors are used so I face some issue as the complexity rises due to increase in the number of sensors 

So that‚Äôs why wanted some example code done in python to see its control flow and structure which is a bit complex

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 07/24/2020 15:10:12

Is it necessary to use and call   /robot/time\_step service  for programming in  rospy script while using Standard ROS controller .?

Because I am facing an issue that is  if I manually donot call /robot/time\_step service in the python script the sensor values donot change  when the robot come near the wall . I use print() command to observe values.

`@Adriana`: can you try it on a different computer? It could be that there is some conflicting software installed on your computer causing Webots to crash... Typically such a crash may be caused by a DLL installed in your `C:\Windows\System32` folder by some third party software.

##### Adriana 07/27/2020 09:14:27
`@Olivier Michel` Thanks for your reply, this information is very valuable to me! I have tried it on other computers and it can be installed successfully. Is there some way to know which dll file conflicts so that I can successfully run webots on my computer?

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 07/27/2020 09:22:24
That is unfortunately difficult to determine. Did you installed any special software on your computer? Do you get any clue in the crash error message? Like it failed in a DLL? Otherwise, you may search for DLLs in your system that may be at the wrong place. I will post a list of DLLs used by Webots. Finally, the ultimate solution is to re-install Windows on your PC, install Webots and then install the other software you need, one-by-one, testing Webots after each install to determine the culprit...

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 07/28/2020 06:31:27
One simple solution is to use the `controllerArgs` field which can be used to defines the argument sent to the controller. This way you can use the same controller for every robot, but use different arguments.

`@David Mansolino`  I'm using a Touch Sensor to detect collision with other objects. I have some boxes in the world already, where I receive a signal when their bounding objects are overlapping with the touch sensor. But when I add my PROTO to the world, the Touch Sensor will not send out/I won't receive signals when the Touch Sensor overlap with the same boxes as previously.

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 07/28/2020 07:41:32
You mean it overlaps? Does the touchsensor bounding object overlaps with another bounding object of the same robot?

##### EPIC 07/28/2020 07:42:11
Update: when I use "USE BEAM1" (not the transform) it works. Then I will detect both the previously boxes aswell as the beam. But when I use the transform instead (and not the last line), it won't detect either the boxes or thea beam.

No, the robot does not have any bounding object itself (only the touch sensor's bounding object on the end-effector).

you simply need to assign a value to this field, then the controller will be started with the argument set as value and you can retrieve them like in any regular program (depending on the language you are using).

True. As long as the physic node is on, it will always fall down (unless you set gravity to 0). Do you not want it to fall down at all, or to fall on the table instead of the ground?

An alternative way is to turn physics off, and do a pure kinematic simulation. You can use Supervisor to simulate grasping, though this require some work..

Oh ok, in that case you can use the Robot 'customData' field instead which can be changed at rutime and retrieved from the controller using the 'wb\_robot\_get\_custom\_data' function: [https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/robot#wb\_robot\_get\_custom\_data](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/robot#wb_robot_get_custom_data)

Hello . I am trying to move my bot's arms but upon executing the code nothing happens . I have added a hinge joint node with rotational motor , inside of that I have set the anchor and axis to my desired location . In the code  , I have used the set position function to say rotate the arm by 90 degrees . In spite of all this , nothing seems to happen . Where am I going wrong ?

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 07/28/2020 14:16:32
is the simulation running with a void controller?

##### watchdogs132 07/28/2020 14:22:39
`@Simon Steinmann`  Nah , it's using my own controller .

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 07/28/2020 14:23:15
try selecting void controller and doubleclicking your robot and manually changing the motor value there


to make sure the issue is your model setup, not the controller

##### watchdogs132 07/28/2020 14:28:22
Thank you . The problem seems to be in my model setup .

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 07/28/2020 14:29:15
you can always add a existing model of a robotic arm and convert it into base nodes and see how it should be set up

you can disable the physics of the base node

hey so how come the mavic is so slow and unstable? I've tried tweaking it to better sim a more agile racing or freestyle quadcopter and no matter what values or how I try to tweak the algo I just can't seem to get it to be stable.... always just wigs out and flips, is it cause of user error or just the physics and engine isn't capable or made for that ?

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 07/28/2020 19:01:36
perhaps try lowering your timestep length


the issue might also be with your controllers

`@TJR` yes, the controller of the mavic is extremely simple and therefore might not be very stable. But yes some people did create an improved version of it, for example:

Is there anyway to have the endpoint node of a rotational motor as the combination of three nodes : shape ,track and track ?.  Right now , I have to create three hinge joint nodes for the above mentioned nodes .

##### Stefania Pedrazzi [cyberbotics] 07/29/2020 06:36:30
`@watchdogs132` you can add a parent Solid node and put the Solid, Track and Track node in the children field

##### watchdogs132 07/29/2020 06:38:19
Yea , basically I created a solid node as the endpoint node , then put the 3 nodes in the child section . But in the bounding object ,I am only able to select the shape node , as a result only the outer boundary of the arms is rotating , the tracks and wheels are remaining intact . Maybe I'm doing something wrong , I will have a look again .

##### Stefania Pedrazzi [cyberbotics] 07/29/2020 06:40:21
Not sure to understand what do you mean.

All the nodes in the endPoint will be rotated when the joint moves, independently if their shape is defined in the bounding object.


Then, it is enough to define the boundingObject shape directly in the Track node, no need to defined again the boundingObject of the Track in the parent Solid node.

##### Alex Nie 07/29/2020 07:58:33
> You're welcome

`@David Mansolino` Webots is really too smart. I just discovered that if there are multiple external controllers controlling multiple robots, then all the robots will only start to move when all the controllers are activated. So there is no need to write a program to control the car and start moving. This feature is greatÔºÅüëç

`@watchdogs132` As you can see , I have created a solid node as the end point node . Inside of the child node , I have placed the shape node and two track nodes . But in the bounding object I am only able to select the shape node . When I move the motor "rot1" , nothing happens .

##### Stefania Pedrazzi [cyberbotics] 07/29/2020 08:18:53
You should define the bounding object of the Track in the `Track.boundingObject` field.

But even without bounding object if you move the joint all the descendant nodes should be moved accordingly


Did you check that your motor has enough torque to move the endPoint? I would suggest you to try to increase the `maxTorque` and see if the solid and the tracks move

##### watchdogs132 07/29/2020 08:26:29
`@Stefania Pedrazzi`  Brilliant . Changing the max torque does the trick . Actually , I did do that earlier , but didn't restart  Webots . Note to self : Always restart Webots after making changes haha !

My code is able to rotate "Axis1" (change the field in the image), but the actual "Axis1" proto (built on a solid) does not rotate


If I change the rotation (or translation) field, then save and reload, the rotation (or translation) happens

##### Stefania Pedrazzi [cyberbotics] 07/29/2020 08:59:05

##### Robsicky 07/29/2020 12:00:46
`@Stefania Pedrazzi`  Hi again. I've done some more testing, and the problem with translating and rotating protos seem to be more general


Translation and rotation of protos that are children of a proto, only take effect after saving and reloading world


I'm able to move "Axis1", but not "Axis2". Also, I'm not trying to move "Forks", so I guess that's why I can move Axis1 despite it being a child of "Forks"

##### Stefania Pedrazzi [cyberbotics] 07/29/2020 12:08:21
There are some known issues with nested PROTO nodes but these are usually related to specific PROTO structures.

Not all the nested PROTO nodes have issues, so we can only inspect your issue by checking the models and the world.

Please open an issue on GitHub and we will have a look at it.


Another thing that you could try, is to check if is maybe already fixed in the latest version by installing the latest nightly build of R2020b:   [https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots/releases/tag/nightly\_27\_7\_2020](https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots/releases/tag/nightly_27_7_2020)

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 07/29/2020 22:01:21
A webots controller interacts with the webots api. But it should be easily adaptable to the api of your robot. To make this easier, it can be a good idea to split your controller into modules that interact with each other and putting all the webots specific things in an extra module and all the logic in another.

Hello, I'd like to know how to get an accurate collision detection.

I'm doing an insertion task. The white box connects with a connector on ur5.(The connection is rigid.) The white box is controlled straight down. However, I have two problems:

1. I found that the white box overlapped with blue box (a bad collision detection). I set basicTimeStep=8

2. There are slipping between white box and blue box when the collision occurs (I already set a large colombFriction(=200) between them)

I'd like to have the performance like this:

When the white box collides with blue box, it has a good collision detection (no overlap) and without slipping.

##### chungshan 07/30/2020 06:52:22

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 07/30/2020 06:56:20
It actually depends on the speed of the motion of the object, there is a tradeoff to find between the time step and the motion of the object.


Not that you can put a world timestep small and use a bigger time step for your controller to save computational power.

##### chungshan 07/30/2020 07:04:45

What is the error you get?


> Another question: which module is responsible for detecting collisions? The ODE-engine?

`@EPIC` yes, ODE is the physics engine.


and collision detection engine

##### unda 07/30/2020 10:17:44
Can some explain how is webot different from gazebo?

##### EPIC 07/30/2020 10:18:03
It has its own collision detection engine? Any name? üôÇ


"ImportError: DLL load failed. The given module was not found"


(I think "given" is the right word atleast, translated from my language)


And the error occurs when it tries to import from \_controller


This is actually the same problems I had when I tried to run the controller from PyCharm the first time.. but this time all the environment variables should be correct.. Maybe I should delete and reinstall?

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 07/30/2020 10:22:55
`@unda`  webots uses an optimized and modified version of ODE physics engine. They added things like multicore processing and fluid simulation. But the devs will be able to tell you more

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 07/30/2020 10:26:06
Here are a few of the main differences:



Webots provides several advantages compared to other open-source robot simulators:

  - Simulations in Webots are reproducible: Reproducibility  is very important to make sure that if you use the same control algorithm your robot will behave exactly the same on two different runs. 

  - Webots is cross-platform, unlike Gazebo, Webots runs on Windows, Linux and macOS.

  - Realistic rendering: As vision is an important area in robotics, it is essential that a simulator can generate highly realistic camera images efficiently. Recently, the rendering engine of Webots has been rewritten from scratch. The new rendering engine allows the simulator to run much faster but also to take advantage of state-of-the-art rendering methods (such as Physics Based Rendering, ambient occlusion, bloom, focus blur, motion blur, etc.) to generate realistic camera images.

  - Improved physics engine: Webots uses an improved version of the Open Dynamics Engine (ODE) to simulate physics. The original version of this simulation engine is widely used by other robot simulators, however, it suffers from instability issues. In the Webots version, the collision detection algorithm was improved to generate much better contacts points (position and number of points) which results in much more stable simulations. This is fundamental for grasping and legged locomotion. Moreover, bug fixes, fluid dynamics and parallelisation were brought to the version of ODE used in Webots, bringing more stability, capabilities and performance comparing to other robot simulators.


Webots provides a cross-language APIs to control the simulated robots (C, C++, Python, Java and MATLAB) and some interface with frameworks such as ROS1 and ROS2.


> It has its own collision detection engine? Any name? üôÇ

`@EPIC` no it uses ODE


> This is actually the same problems I had when I tried to run the controller from PyCharm the first time.. but this time all the environment variables should be correct.. Maybe I should delete and reinstall?

`@EPIC` yes, maybe it would be good to try recreating a new pyCharm project from scratch (no need to delete the current one, keep it as a backup): [https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/using-your-ide?version=documentation-enhacement-pycharm-instructions](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/using-your-ide?version=documentation-enhacement-pycharm-instructions)

`@David Mansolino` `@unda`   This is one of the biggest advantages of webots compared to all other simulators I've tried. Incredibly detailed documentation and native support for the listed languages. Not just a often slow and incomplete wrapper for let's say python

##### EPIC 07/30/2020 13:16:27
I think "getProtoField" would be better than "getField" though


2020b


Maybe I messed up in my PROTO, so that the "enableBoundingObject" is not accessible for Supervisor..?

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 07/30/2020 13:17:38

The simulation was just running. And suddenly that error appeared.

##### EPIC 07/30/2020 15:35:45

Ok so if you save world state after closing camera fpv camera window in simulation then it won't open back up after world reload... and can't find way to manually do it.

`@trunc8`  Saving the world and  reset simulation

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 07/31/2020 05:45:04
`@Alex Nie` you can use in your controller the `wb_robot_get_time`  ([https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/robot#wb\_robot\_get\_time](https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/robot#wb_robot_get_time)) function to get the simulation time and act depending on the time.


> Or retrieve this environment in some other way? I wish to have it present at t=0.

`@trunc8` to avoid this in the Future I would recommend setting the starting mode to pause in the preferences: [https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/preferences#general](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/preferences#general)


> Ok so if you save world state after closing camera fpv camera window in simulation then it won't open back up after world reload... and can't find way to manually do it.

`@kentevan` can you please remember me which approach you are talking about?


> Another remark. It's "gravity 9.81" now. My objects just flew away ü§£

`@Majanao` you should set 'gravity' to -9.81 and 'coordinateSystem' to 'ENU'.


Did you updated manually the header (`#VRML_SIM ...`) of the world file?

##### trunc8 07/31/2020 05:58:28

`@Alex Nie` Thanks, worked for me! The tutorials had recommended to avoid doing this as it would accumulate error. How does that work?

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 07/31/2020 06:29:51
To make sure your world is 'clean' it is recommended to open your world file in a text edirot, and remove all the lines starting with 'hidden'.

Hi! Is using Lua in protos to change translations and rotations generally a bad idea? From the warnings I get, I assume this should be avoided:

```
PROTO example [
    field SFVec3f       translation    0 0 0
    field SFRotation    rotation       0 1 0 0
]
{
    Solid {
        %{
            local T = fields.translation.value
            local R = fields.rotation.value
        }%
        translation %{=T.x}% %{=T.y}% %{=T.z}%
        rotation %{=R.x}% %{=R.y}% %{=R.z}% %{=R.a}%

    }
}
```


But I also tried to set the translation and rotation of a Transform inside the Solid, and this also resulted in my simulation freezing for a moment

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 07/31/2020 08:26:41
Yes, that is indeed a bad idea, one problem for example will be that when you move the object with the handles in Webots, it will generate many many regeneration of the PROTO.


But in most of the case there are some workaround. What do you wahtn to achieve exactly?

In my PROTO, I've added a "SFInt32" field. This counter will decide how many objects I'm going to have as a child, in the Solid node. But I want the objects to be placed at specific places, and therefore use a table to give the new objects their translation and rotation


So it's only the PROTO itself that need to know the values

`@Tacobellington` did you installed Python from [https://www.python.org/downloads](https://www.python.org/downloads) ?

I would also try setting in the Webots Preferences the 'python command' to the absolute path of the Python application.


> How can I store the experimental values/console display values to a text file?

`@Akash` like in any regular programm, you simply have to open a file and write to it, which language are you using?


> In the section of 'Interfacing Webots to Third Party Software with TCP/IP', 

> how to run the code of client.c? 3Q

`@tangdan` you have to compile it and then you will be able to run it.

That seems correct. The rotating board should be added in the `endPoint` field of the `HingeJoint` node.

> That seems correct. The rotating board should be added in the `endPoint` field of the `HingeJoint` node.

`@Olivier Michel` I added two solids now? Is there anything I need to add more? Anything in the hinge joint parameter? This structure should go down when the robot approaches towards the end of it.

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 08/03/2020 09:31:41
Yes, it should work.

##### saditya 08/03/2020 09:54:41

`@Olivier Michel` The second part which i added in the hinge joint , end point that part doesn't go down when the robot is on it. Did i do something wrong?

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 08/03/2020 09:59:04
Did you add a Physics node to your board Solid?


And a boundingObject?

##### watchdogs132 08/03/2020 10:02:13
"WARNING: The current physics step could not be computed correctly. Your world may be too complex. If this problem persists, try simplifying your bounding object(s), reducing the number of joints, or reducing WorldInfo.basicTimeStep."

I'm getting this error , as a result my bot, in majority of my iterations gets stuck while climbing the stairs . Is there a tool or a trick to know which bounding objects are causing the problem ? .

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 08/03/2020 10:04:08
I would recommend you to simplify the world file until the warning disappear. You will then understand who is the culprit...


This kind of error is often caused by mechanical loops (e.g., an object getting in contact with another object connected to itself via a series of joints)

##### oroulet 08/03/2020 10:35:46
RangeFinder.GetRangeImage()sometimes returns None in python. Reloading and restarting robot controller seems to fix it.. until the next restart of robot controller...

What can be the reason? when does GetRangeImage is supposed to return None?

We enable the camera one step before taking the picture then disable it again in the same step

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 08/03/2020 10:37:52
Is it a reproducible problem or does it occur randomly?

##### oroulet 08/03/2020 10:40:00
at least very easy to reproduce in our environment. but our environment starts to be a bit complicated now

I can try to simplify it and send it over but  I was wondering if there is some known situastions where this can happen

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 08/03/2020 10:40:31
GetRangeImage should return None if the sensor is indeed disabled or was enabled but the robot step amount of time elapsed since enable is inferior to the value passed to the enable function.


Like, enable(10), step(9) GetRangeImage would return None.


enable(10), step(10), GetRangeImage would return an image.

##### oroulet 08/03/2020 10:42:52
thanks. So at least it seems to be an enabling issue. Right now I am using enable(64) and step(64)....

##### saditya 08/03/2020 11:16:31
> Did you add a Physics node to your board Solid?

`@Olivier Michel` IN the SS you can see that this is the second half of the board which needs to act as a see saw? Should both the solids(main) and solid(end point) have a physics node? At the moment they both have a bounding object and one of them has a physics node as seen. Also does it have something to do with the mass? It's at -1 which i guess maybe wrong.

%end

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 08/03/2020 11:49:30
Leaving the mass to -1 is fine (mass will be computed according to the density and bounding object volume).


Your screenshot looks good. It should work as expected. If not you may have to adjust the HingeJointParameter fields.

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 08/03/2020 12:54:12
To test it, I would simply apply a force on the seesaw using Alt + mouse left click.


It should move (rotate about the hinge)


You may have a look at this example which relies on passive hinge joints as well: [https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/samples-howto#passive\_dynamic\_walker-wbt](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/samples-howto#passive_dynamic_walker-wbt)

##### saditya 08/03/2020 12:57:45

`@Olivier Michel` As per your advice, I tried and it doesn't not move. It remains as it was on applying force.

##### Stefania Pedrazzi [cyberbotics] 08/03/2020 13:42:00
`@Robsicky` the `Supervisor.getPosition` node works only for Transform (or derived) nodes. So if your PROTO node is based on the `Slot` node, then the  `getPosition` function is not available.

Oki


Thanks

##### Stefania Pedrazzi [cyberbotics] 08/03/2020 13:44:13
you can work around this by adding a dummy Node at the Slot root location that is visible from the scene tree (i.e. that is defined in the PROTO fields)

`@Olivier Michel` does the 'run realtime' try to keep the R factor at 1, or does it actually try to synchronize with system time? Meaning: does it speed up a little if there was a little hitch and it fell behind

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 08/03/2020 15:57:33
`run real-time` tries to keep the speedometer value as close as possible to 1, based on system time and the recent history of time steps. It may hence speed-up or slow down depending on its evaluation of the amount of time needed to sleep.

##### alxy 08/03/2020 17:30:53
Hello, I am having problems adapting this example of a robotic arm ([https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/irb4600-40](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/irb4600-40)) to a custom arm, namely the Mirobot by Wlkata ([https://www.wlkata.com/](https://www.wlkata.com/)). I created a proto file of the arm and that all worked nicely, but I am unable to get the integration with the inverse kinematics library working. The arm does move, however it is far from a position a would assume him to be. Is there anything I need to take care of if I go from world coordinates to the required joint angles?

Yes, the gate Solid without Physics (so that it is attached to the static world) should be connect to the axe Solid using a HingeJoint allowing the rotation. Then, you should add a motor in the HingeJoint to control it.

`@(,-*-)` instead of encapsulating the call to `robot_receiver.nextPacket()` in a `try`, you should rather use this kind of structure:

```python
while robot_receiver.getQueueLength(self) > 0:
  msg = robot_receiver.getData()
  joint_positions = struct.unpack("ddddd",msg)
  robot_receiver.nextPacket()
```


> `@Olivier Michel` Can we design these modified shapes on WEBOTS? Like the axe gate? Or do I need to use some designing software and import it to WEBOTS?

`@saditya` it is probably simpler to design the shape in an external 3D modelling software such as Blender

One little thing, Im updating now, because worlds created with the new release cannot be opened with an old version. For people with a regular install, webots gets updated automatically?


I think the gravity notation change causes the issue

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 08/04/2020 13:37:07
Webots R2020b should be able to open worlds created with R2020a and automatically update the gravity.

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 08/04/2020 13:37:36
What was the value of the gravity you were using in R2020a ?

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 08/04/2020 13:37:38
yes, but not the other way around. So if someone is running a old version and tries to open a file from a collegue, it doesnt work

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 08/04/2020 13:37:48
(that may not work if the world was created with a nightly build of R2020b).

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 08/04/2020 13:38:24
I'm on 2020b and cannot open 2020a world


gravity 0 0 -9.81  vs gravity 9.81

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 08/04/2020 13:38:52
As a quick fix, you can simply change the header (first line) of your world/proto file and write R2020a instead of R2020b.


Then Webots R2020b should be able to open/convert it.

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 08/04/2020 13:39:29
i'm just wanna make sure that people who use a normal install of webots dont run into that problem

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 08/04/2020 13:39:57
In that case, I would recommend you to open and save your world with R2020b and require your users to use R2020b.

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 08/04/2020 13:43:53
You probably just need to set the contact properties between he wheel and the road.

Here is an example: [https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots/blob/master/projects/vehicles/worlds/city.wbt#L14-L74](https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots/blob/master/projects/vehicles/worlds/city.wbt#L14-L74)

##### Vaibhav 08/04/2020 13:45:20
Okayy thanks I'm new to the software

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 08/04/2020 13:45:35
You're welcome


They key point to solve the problem is to set the 'softCFM' of the contact properties to something around '1e-05' to make the ground less soft.

##### Vaibhav 08/04/2020 13:46:52
Okayy ill try that

how do I launch webots isntalled with tarball?

Go to the `webots` folder and type `./webots`.

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 08/04/2020 13:59:20
thx


How is gravity direction defined now?


can we change what is 'up'

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 08/04/2020 14:08:14
By the "coordinateSystem" field of WorldInfo.


You can choose between "ENU" (X: east, Y: north, Z: Up) and "NUE" (X: north, Y: up and Z: east).

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 08/04/2020 14:12:19
I think it shoud say that where you can select it (what you said in bracket)


many people wont know what that is


should I open an issue on github?


I cannot import the controller in python since the tarball isntall

nvm, found the issue

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 08/04/2020 14:27:46
Did you set the PYTHONPATH?

IT seems you are using anaconda, did you recompile the PYthon API for anaconda?

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 08/04/2020 14:27:57
export WEBOTS\_HOME='/home/simon/webots/webots'   missed the extra webots üòÑ

It is explained on this documentation page: [https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/worldinfo](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/worldinfo). Where else would you like to see it explained?

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 08/04/2020 14:31:48
`@Olivier Michel` I think changing the dropdown options in the webots gui to 

"ENU" (X: east, Y: north, Z: Up)  

"NUE" (X: north, Y: up ,  Z: east)

would be nice


instead of just enu and nue

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 08/04/2020 14:33:21
About your error, it seems there are somme issue with PYTHON 2.7 VS 3.7

You are using 3.7 and you PYTHONPATH contains probably the path to the Webots Python 2.7 API

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 08/04/2020 14:34:50
PYTHONPATH should contain only one of the '/lib/controller/pythonXY'


otherewise there might be some confusions.

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 08/04/2020 14:35:02
it worked before with the nightly build installed in  /usr/local

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 08/04/2020 14:36:18
`@Simon Steinmann`: that is not easy to implement without making a special case for this. Anyhow, if you right click on `coordinateSystem` in the scene tree, you can get the Help menu that goes to the documentation page.

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 08/04/2020 14:37:53
how about change it to EastNorthUp and NorthUpEast


I'm thinking about newcomers to robotics and webots itself. It's just an extra thing that can be confusing

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 08/04/2020 14:38:58
ENU is a well known convention. See [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axes\_conventions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axes_conventions)

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 08/04/2020 14:40:43
I studied aerospace engineering and was not familiar with the term. I think there are a significant amount of people who aren't either. It can be easy to forget how daunting something new can be, when we've worked in an area for a while. I just started last year with robotics and simulation... so I still remember üòÑ


just a little suggestion for newcomer friendliness

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 08/04/2020 14:43:11
Yes, I understand. I will be thinking to find a good solution to make it easier newcomers.

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 08/04/2020 14:43:52
`@David Mansolino` only adding the actual python version used to the PYTHONPATH works


hmm why did it work in the past though? allowed for quick switching between python2 and 3

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 08/04/2020 14:44:56
Maybe you were using python2 by default before?

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 08/04/2020 14:45:58
`@Olivier Michel` Tooltips in general could be a great idea. Perhaps in the area where we can edit fields, there could be a tooltip tab (bottom left of image)

`@David Mansolino` it didnt matter which conda environment I was in, and whether it used python2 or 3 by default

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 08/04/2020 14:47:19
Ok, in that case it is indeed strange that it was working, but generally speaking it is safer to add the path to only one of the version

GitHub, yes.

##### Robsicky 08/04/2020 14:54:43
Hi! If I got:

```
field = parent.getField("children")
```

Is there a way to get a handle to the parent from  the variable "field"?


I often pass ".getField("children")" as argument in my methods, so the parent is not present in that scope

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 08/04/2020 14:57:10
It's possible but a bit complicated...

##### Robsicky 08/04/2020 14:57:52
Oki, so maybe better to just include the parent as arg?

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 08/04/2020 14:58:10
You can use `wb_supervisor_node_get_parent_node()` [https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/supervisor#wb\_supervisor\_node\_get\_parent\_node](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/supervisor#wb_supervisor_node_get_parent_node)


Yes, I believe it's better.

##### Robsicky 08/04/2020 15:02:38
But `wb_supervisor_node_get_parent_node()` is a node method? Tried it, and did not work with the field handle

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 08/04/2020 15:03:14
Of course, you need to get the nodes from the children field, this is why I said it's complicated.

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 08/04/2020 15:12:20

Mh, let me see if I can get it working by taking the urdf definition directly from the supervisor. Do I absolutely need 2020b or is 2020a also fine?

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 08/04/2020 16:10:27
You need R2020b to get the URDF from a supervisor.

##### alxy 08/04/2020 16:11:03
yes, just realized it from my very first test üòÑ


I also see that there have been some changes to the source files in this PR ( [https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots/pull/2062/files](https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots/pull/2062/files) ) which probably have not yet made it to the installer package. Is this an issue?

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 08/04/2020 16:16:16
It could be. If something doesn't work with R2020b, I would advise to check the next nightly build...

##### alxy 08/04/2020 17:05:39
One more question regarding the inverse kinemticas example: If I rotate my robot arm or even translate it, I need to do the same transformations to my world x,y,z coordinates right? As the inverse kinematics chain will always be relative the arms base I assume (it doesnt know about rotations/translations with regards to the outer world)


I have tried to apply the following transform to my coorinates, but still my arm is behaving very weird. It moves, but not to the coorinates I specify:

> miro\_rot = np.array(mirobot.getOrientation())

> miro\_rot = miro\_rot.reshape(3, 3)

> \# Transform coords to Mirobot-CoordinateSystem

> coords\_trans = np.dot(miro\_rot, [x, y, z])

> 

> \# Call "ikpy" to compute the inverse kinematics of the arm.

> ikResults = armChain.inverse\_kinematics(coords\_trans)

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 08/04/2020 17:29:08
Take a look at this and read the example code  I made of how to get relative positions

[https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/supervisor?tab-language=python#wb\_supervisor\_node\_get\_position](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/supervisor?tab-language=python#wb_supervisor_node_get_position)


code should be easily adaptable to your needs

##### alxy 08/04/2020 17:30:34
I have seen and used that already, Im just unsure if I need that, as the example does not use any transofmration on the coords ( [https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots/blob/master/projects/robots/abb/irb/controllers/inverse\_kinematics/inverse\_kinematics.py#L62-L67](https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots/blob/master/projects/robots/abb/irb/controllers/inverse_kinematics/inverse_kinematics.py#L62-L67) )


And I just checked, the arm itself is also rotated and translated, i.e not in the world origin

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 08/04/2020 17:35:19
I think you forgot this step: rot\_ur10e = np.transpose(rot\_ur10e)


you wanna get from the robot to your position, not from your position to your robot


miro\_rot = np.array(mirobot.getOrientation())

miro\_rot = miro\_rot.reshape(3, 3)

miro\_rot = np.transpose(miro\_rot)

\# Transform coords to Mirobot-CoordinateSystem

coords\_trans = np.dot(miro\_rot, [x, y, z])



\# Call "ikpy" to compute the inverse kinematics of the arm.

ikResults = armChain.inverse\_kinematics(coords\_trans)



\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

This should be your code I think


`@alxy` does this work?

##### alxy 08/04/2020 17:47:51
I have tried that as well without luck üò¶ I mean it kind of works, on some axes I have the feeling the arm is moving correctly, but on others its completely wrong


anyway, thanks for your help. Its really a quite active channel here üôÇ

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 08/04/2020 17:50:18
ohh, you're missing another line


miro\_pos = np.array(mirobot.getPosition())

pos = np.subtract([x, y, z], miro\_pos)

coords\_trans = np.dot(miro\_rot, pos)


you forgot to translate the position üòÑ


that should work

##### alxy 08/04/2020 17:58:18
no, the base is located in the origin at [0, 0, 0]

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 08/04/2020 18:00:09
then it is strange indeed


ohhhh wait


you're using your own urdf arent you?


converted it with urdf2proto

##### alxy 08/04/2020 18:00:30
right

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 08/04/2020 18:00:48
that's a bug with that software. Some joints will be flipped


try loading the urdf into rviz and check which way the robot rotates when increasing each joint. load the protos in webots with a void controller, doubleclick on the bot and increase the same motor. Make sure that it rotates the same way


if it is t he wrong way, change the rotation axis in the proto file from -1 to 1 or vice versa

##### alxy 08/04/2020 18:08:43
ok, thats a good hint üòÑ

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 08/04/2020 18:08:56

had the exact same issue when converting the kinova gen3 arm


Would be cool if you could add the robot here once you figure it out :

##### alxy 08/04/2020 18:10:50

Just to make sure, its this lib which has the bug: [https://github.com/cyberbotics/urdf2webots](https://github.com/cyberbotics/urdf2webots) ?


cause thats the one I was using


and is there an alternative to rviz, it appears to be hard to install on windows and is rather large

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 08/04/2020 18:20:54
yes, that's the one


I could have a look if you send me the urdf


do they have a ros implementation?

Does TouchSensor check collision with all boundingObjects every step, or is there some search tree or algorithm?

Usually with every step.

`@David Mansolino` This is what happens when I simulate it, all the objects have mass, physics, and bounding object. I want the 0.2kg to take the side up just as it happens in a see-saw. Am I doing something wrong?

Is the red box a children of the structure or is it independant?

It is strange that the box goes through the board. Can you put it at a better location (on the board instead of inside the board)?

`@Simon Steinmann` probably yes, can you add a comment on this issue including the urdf files so that when we fix it we have several test files to make sure the fix is correct.

##### saditya 08/05/2020 10:52:12
> It is strange that the box goes through the board. Can you put it at a better location (on the board instead of inside the board)?

`@Olivier Michel` Thanks for your reply.  I have to keep this design constraint  in mind- The normal position of the seesaw is horizontal and it is supported by the ramp. This means that the seesaw will remain horizontal when a vehicle moves from the ramp to the seesaw until the vehicle passes the support point. It will

require approx. 200 g of impact 20 cm from the support point before the seesaw tilts.--- So i moved it 0,2m in the direction.

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 08/05/2020 10:56:47
Yes, but I meant for testing purposes. The first thing you should achieve is probably to run a simple seesaw. Then you could extend it to your use case.

##### saditya 08/05/2020 10:57:47
> Is the red box a children of the structure or is it independant?

`@David Mansolino` That is where the red box is.

`@David Mansolino` I just needed it for three different solids. The base, see saw, and the box.


> Yes, but I meant for testing purposes. The first thing you should achieve is probably to run a simple seesaw. Then you could extend it to your use case.

`@Olivier Michel` That is how it behaves when i keep the 0.2 kg above the board and run the simulation. Do you think it exhibits the right behavior? I want the this red box to be fixed on the seesaw somehow.

`@Sukrati Chaturvedi`: the most recent version of Webots is the best.


`@saditya`: You should merge the red box with the board by creating a compound object. See tutorial here: [https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/tutorial-5-compound-solid-and-physics-attributes](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/tutorial-5-compound-solid-and-physics-attributes)

One simple solution is to put the mesh in a dedicated file (i.e. another PROTO).

how does one do that? and can that be automated with the urdf2proto?

Or use the `Mesh` primitive to store mesh data in separate native 3D files.

You might wanna look into adding the realsense cameras too. Having read countless robotics / Machine and Reinforcement Learing Papers, these are most commonly used. Integration would make webots very attractive for those sort of applications.


on a similar note, are you familiar with domain randomization?

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 08/05/2020 15:00:23
Not really

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 08/05/2020 15:01:37
Domain randomization, a simple technique for training models on simulated images that transfer to real images by randomizing rendering in the simulator. With enough variability in the simulator, the real world may appear to the model as just another variation

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 08/05/2020 15:02:38

I dont know how much of a focus and priority AI / Reinforcement Learning / Machine Learing is  with you guys, but I highly recommend you look into this field in general. It is rapidly growing and robotics moves more and more into this direction.

{the rho parameter is unfortunately not set it therefore keeps the default value (0 or very close to). IF you need this parameters and want us to add it, please open a feature request here to explain why this parameter is important and we will add it:}



Does the simulation assume that the robot has stopped at each sampling time and calculate the next movement with static friction coefficient?

`@jinu061353` no, mu is used for dynamic friction too: [http://ode.org/wiki/index.php?title=Manual#Contact](http://ode.org/wiki/index.php?title=Manual#Contact)


> `@David Mansolino` thanks, good to know. This is done purely on gpu though right? So it wouldnt affect physics simulation much

`@Simon Steinmann` yes, this is only for rendering and sensors (such as light sensors) simulation.

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 08/06/2020 10:49:13
mu is static friction and rho dynamic right? I looked into this a while back, and back then it didnt seem possible to have proper dynamic friction. It would be great if mu is added to contactProperties

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 08/06/2020 10:50:21
mu, is actually the ``coulombFriction`` field.

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 08/06/2020 10:50:41

the dynamic friction


usually mu > rho. And in many application such as sliding objects or slip conditions for wheels, it would be very helpful to have this

`@David Mansolino` How much work would it be to add a option '--robotic-arm' to urdf2webots. Adding in the static base and ToolSlot? IF that were to be added, I could convert the whole KUKA repo

Hi All, I'm a possible new user for webots, but have some questions. I would like to try and simulate a trike like robot, but the single front wheel both drives the robot and is steerable. the two backwheels are essentially caster wheels. is something like that possible to simulate using webots ?

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 08/07/2020 12:08:16
Yes sure, I would start by the tutorial, this one in particular explains how to create a non-steerable 4wheel vehicle: [https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/tutorial-6-4-wheels-robot](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/tutorial-6-4-wheels-robot)

`@David Mansolino` As you can see it should be 3.63m long and 0.6m wide. But when i try to adjust with the height of the solid i connect to it just decreases because the rest of the solid(box) goes below the map to make the surface inclined.

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 08/07/2020 15:03:14
It simply a directionnal light, whose direction and intensity mathes the background from 'texturedBackground'

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 08/07/2020 15:04:24
is luminosity the same as intensity in the directionLight?

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 08/07/2020 15:05:30
Yes, it is linked to the DirectionalLight.intensity field.

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 08/07/2020 15:06:20
but it doesnt seem to be exacgtly the same, adding a directional light and having it shine straight down, with intensity = 1, is quite a bit darker than the luminosity = 1

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 08/07/2020 15:17:53
Yes, there is a multiplication factor depending on the texture: [https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots/blob/master/projects/objects/backgrounds/protos/TexturedBackgroundLight.proto#L114](https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots/blob/master/projects/objects/backgrounds/protos/TexturedBackgroundLight.proto#L114)

call the `removeSF()` method on the field.

##### hero 08/08/2020 13:20:39
Hi, Does the complex environment like as complete apartment affect the controller speed with respect to a simple rectangular area?

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 08/08/2020 13:37:39
Generally, the complexer the scene, the more your GPU has to work to render it. That should not be a problem on most computers, unless you make it very complex. What is usually the limiting factor is the physics simulation. If you have mostly static objects in a large scene and what your are simulating is limited to a few objects, it should still be very fast.


The simulation and controller are also 2 different things. You can have a very complex controller, doing some compicated calculations, taking longer than the actual simulation step and vice versa

`@Samir Hosny Mohamed`: which index.html did you use? The one from the WEBOTS\_HOME/resources/web/streaming\_viewer/index.html? This one is actually to connect to a Webots instance without the session and simulation servers.


You need to write your own web page (index.html) that will initialize `webots.js` so that it uses the session and simulation servers you are running.


An example of this is provided here: [https://github.com/cyberbotics/simgait/blob/master/html/js/simulation.js](https://github.com/cyberbotics/simgait/blob/master/html/js/simulation.js)

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 08/10/2020 11:35:08
You can make the slope with a Box primitive that you will slightly rotate, but without Physics as I guess you want it to be static (not moveable).

> You can make the slope with a Box primitive that you will slightly rotate, but without Physics as I guess you want it to be static (not moveable).

`@Olivier Michel` Thanks, can you guide me a bit? I have the slope and see-saw ready? I just need to add a supporting structure to the base so that it is flat, and once the robot moves on top of it it act as a seesaw.

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 08/10/2020 11:38:06
Can you post a screenshot of what you have and what you want to achieve?

##### saditya 08/10/2020 11:42:39
> Can you post a screenshot of what you have and what you want to achieve?

`@Olivier Michel` Right now the the see saw is on the floor. I want it to connect it to the green structure(slope). It needs to rest as the way I sent you the previous picture. When the simulation runs it should be resting flat, and when the robot moves on the top and move for some distance it will act as a see saw. `@Olivier Michel`

%end

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 08/10/2020 11:45:18
In that case simply attaching the seesaw base to the static environment (no Physics) and the slope to the static environment as well should make the two parts unmovable. That should be sufficient.

> In that case simply attaching the seesaw base to the static environment (no Physics) and the slope to the static environment as well should make the two parts unmovable. That should be sufficient.

`@Olivier Michel` Alright, sounds good. But i am still a bit confused. Can I add a solid node to the the slope and make the the see saw rest on it? DO you think that is a good idea?

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 08/10/2020 11:49:57
There is no need for that.

##### saditya 08/10/2020 11:51:28
> There is no need for that.

`@Olivier Michel` Can you tell me in a few steps what should i do next? I have the structure ready. The see saw has 0.2kg structure below it to make it tilt as well.

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 08/10/2020 11:52:56
Simply positioning the slope next to the seesaw should be sufficient.

##### saditya 08/10/2020 12:04:05
> Simply positioning the slope next to the seesaw should be sufficient.

`@Olivier Michel` This is the static world. I want this entire structure to be flat, but when I will run the simulation the see saw will fall down because it has mass and physics. Lol my bad. I don't understand this. I want the see saw at a certain height above the ground.

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 08/10/2020 12:15:24
If it is attached to the static world, the seesaw shouldn't fall.

##### saditya 08/10/2020 12:16:10
> If it is attached to the static world, the seesaw shouldn't fall.

`@Olivier Michel` Can I raise the height of the base , of the seesaw? To make it above from the grounD?

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 08/10/2020 12:16:24
Sure.

##### saditya 08/10/2020 12:29:38
> Simply positioning the slope next to the seesaw should be sufficient.

`@Olivier Michel` i DID THAT does not work , it doesnt remain flat.

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 08/10/2020 12:36:01
Sorry, but it's difficult to further help you without having a look at your simulation. I will be able to do that if you subscribe to a Premier service, see [https://www.cyberbotics.com/#plans](https://www.cyberbotics.com/#plans).

##### saditya 08/10/2020 13:29:42
> Sure.

`@Olivier Michel` I tried this way, the behavior and everything is fine. But I don't want the other side of the seesaw to completely hit the ground. Should I increase the size of the box(base) or the translation of the box(base)?

`@Samir Hosny Mohamed` this happens because using the function getPosition() in the supervisor mode !

Which version of Webots are you using?

##### Samir Hosny Mohamed 08/11/2020 08:03:49
R2020a

##### Shadow 08/11/2020 14:46:29
Is there a maximum range for distance sensors? No matter how big my lookup table is it always seems to max out at the max lookup table value at the same distance every time.

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 08/11/2020 14:47:18
The maximum distance is indeed the last value of the lookup table.

##### Shadow 08/11/2020 14:48:01
This doesn't seem to help as no matter the value over a specific point the max distance seems to stay the same.

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 08/11/2020 14:49:19
Did you try to save and revert after changing the lookupTable?

##### Shadow 08/11/2020 14:49:33
Yes

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 08/11/2020 14:50:01
What is the maximum distance value you get?

##### Shadow 08/11/2020 14:50:56
It goes from a read value of 0.16 instantly up to my maximum lookup table value of 10.

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 08/11/2020 14:51:33
Can you copy/paste your lookupTable here?

##### Shadow 08/11/2020 14:54:10
It's just 0 0 then 10 10 with no noise

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 08/11/2020 14:56:02
So, it's `[ 0 0 0, 10 10 0 ]`, correct?

##### Shadow 08/11/2020 14:56:31
yes

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 08/11/2020 14:59:02
And when you set it to `[ 0 0 0, 100 100, 0]` the range doesn't change?

##### Shadow 08/11/2020 14:59:52
No it does the same 0.16 to 100 issue.

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 08/11/2020 15:01:49
It is probable that the problem is rather related to the environment rather to the sensor


did you tried with severa kind of obstacles?

##### Shadow 08/11/2020 15:03:48
It is a flat wall and the environment is a maze so only has flat walls.

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 08/11/2020 15:06:41
It could be some part of your robot occluding the sensor ray for a few time steps. Can you activate the distance sensor ray visualization in the View menu and run the simulation step-by-step?

##### Shadow 08/11/2020 15:08:00
I'm using the e-puck robot and customising it and I've been using the visualisation and the length of the rays increase with the increasing lookup table max value however the colour goes red at the same distance every time.

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 08/11/2020 15:09:06
Can you revert to a non-customized e-puck robot for which you would change only the lookupTable?

##### Shadow 08/11/2020 15:10:02
That is mostly the only thing I am changing about the e-puck


Do you have any idea what the solution might be?

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 08/11/2020 16:05:01
Sorry, no.

##### Shadow 08/11/2020 16:05:50
So there is no way to increase the distance sensor range?

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 08/11/2020 16:07:11
Yes, it should work. I don't know why it doesn't for you. Do you have an active Premier service for user support?

##### Shadow 08/11/2020 16:07:38
No I do not

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 08/11/2020 16:13:58

`@KelvinYang0320` I'm inspecting the bug you reported and will be fixed in the next version of Webots R2020b revision 1 that we will be released soon.

For the moment I can suggest you a workaround that simply consists in explicitly deleting the `POLE_ENDPOINT` node before deleting the `ROBOT` node:

```
def respawnRobot(self):
        if self.robot is not None:

Hi, I'm having issues with distance sensors where if they are at a specific angle to a wall, the reading will be always max no matter the distance away. At other angles it works perfectly.

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 08/13/2020 11:15:42
Is the distance sensor type 'sonar'?

If yes, this probably explains what you are experiencing: [https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/distancesensor#sonar-sensors](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/distancesensor#sonar-sensors)

`@Olivier Michel` I did try but does not work well. I have distance sensors to be precise, however I am trying to have a line following behavior. Before I run any mission, i need to calibrate my sensors for edge detection. I move the robot on the white line and calibrate sensors , and i get certain values. When I need to calibrate it for the black environment, I get same values of Reflection from the reflections from the black surface. Am i doing something wrong here? `@Darko Lukiƒá` if you could help?

`@David Mansolino` This is an interface which is normal conditions should spit out values which have different values (tested before on different experiments) not on WEBOTS. They should have different values. But it doesn't.

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 08/14/2020 05:51:03
> Hello 

> Is it normal for Webots to be slow in animations, and produce strange sound?

`@areiban` the strange sounds are contact sounds (which I have to admit are not calibrated for most of the simulation), but you can easily disable sound from the toolbar.


About the animation speed, you should try reducing the advanced rendering feature from the OpenGL tab of the preferences: [https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/preferences#opengl](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/preferences#opengl)


> hello can i control only one wheel of youbot ?

`@MarioAndres7` Yes sure, for this you have to use low level control of the wheel. You can check how to do this in the sources of the youbot library: [https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots/blob/master/projects/robots/kuka/youbot/libraries/youbot\_control/src/base.c](https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots/blob/master/projects/robots/kuka/youbot/libraries/youbot_control/src/base.c)

But I would recommend following this tutorial (it works the smae way for the youbot): [https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/tutorial-4-more-about-controllers](https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/tutorial-4-more-about-controllers)

You should probably add a hinge joint and tune the spring and damping parameters.

That is instead of a rigid body link

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 08/14/2020 06:51:34
This may not be easy as Webots relies on a rigid body physics engine (ODE). But you can approximate soft bodies by building a series of small rigid bodies connected to each other with joints.


See for example [https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/samples-howto#rope-wbt](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/samples-howto#rope-wbt).

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 08/15/2020 15:24:15
there should be a scale property

##### alxy 08/15/2020 15:26:09
this proto file only defines translation, rotation and controller als porperties


I dont see a scale option, and if I read the documentation correctly it appears this is on purpose:

> In PROTO nodes that correspond to real world objects, it is not recommend to add fields such as mass or scale. This is because in real life, you cannot change the mass or the size of an object. And we don't want to encourage users of the PROTO nodes to do so, as it may lead to non-realistic models and numerical instabilities. Some exceptions however exist. For example, it may be convenient to add a size field to a Matryoshka doll PROTO. Nevertheless, such a size field should be limited to a minimal and a maximal size or to a limited range of integer values. Therefore it could be either a floating point or an integer value.


Ok, I was able to put it into a transform node which has the scale property indeed. Just unsure if this is the best option....

> Is it possible to control the gripper and the arm from the same controller?

`@alxy` If they're a part of the same Robot node  then you just have to instantiate all the motors and other devices properly (you have to use the correct names of the motors and so on). You can find the names of devices in the world info window left of the simulation with the rest of the robot properties. If you don't see them then you're using the PROTO node and not the Robot node. To convert, just right click on the Robot in the world info window and the click conver to Base node(s)

if the force is too high, it can go through. The default torques are 100 Nm, which is huge in such a small gripper


you could enable force feedback, and only grip with a certain force


or set the maximum torque of the motors lower

##### alxy 08/15/2020 19:26:44
let me try that

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 08/15/2020 19:27:10
also try to only close them as much as they need to, in order to grab the box

##### alxy 08/15/2020 19:28:39
yeah that would be optimal, however the real robot also only knows "open" and "close" for the valve, no matter the object it grips


Th default toque fr this gripper was 1000

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 08/15/2020 19:31:20
but the real robot has appropiate gripping force

##### alxy 08/15/2020 19:32:00
yeah, reducing all motor to 10Nm works


thanks!

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 08/15/2020 19:32:22
you're welcome üôÇ

##### alxy 08/15/2020 19:33:08
Im really curious how close it will be compared to reality

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 08/15/2020 19:37:52
really depends on the hardware, the hardware controller, the software controller and how well the simulated model reflects reality. If you put some work into it, it should be pretty damn accurate

##### alxy 08/15/2020 19:42:25
Looks alright so far, theoretically I have the ROS controller for the mirobot as well, but that looked extremely complex to setup. And as I really just need a way to quickly test python code we write using this library fro the mirobot ( [https://github.com/rirze/mirobot-py](https://github.com/rirze/mirobot-py) ), I decided to exchange the serial itnerface with an ip based interface where the webots controller is the server side and just executes the commands send by that lib. And it works so far üôÇ Just kind of tedious to reimplement all the gcodes that it sends.


Another question: The Mirobot.proto generated by the urdf converter always displays an error `ERROR: 'F:/Code/my_first_simulation/protos/Mirobot.proto':11:20: error: Type mismatch between 'controllerArgs' PROTO parameter and field 'controllerArgs'.`


I think it is because the documentation says it must be MFString controllerArgs  []       # any string, where the proto files contains field SFString   controllerArgs  ""

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 08/15/2020 19:55:33
yeah, change the proto file


I'll have a look at the code tomorrow and check, perhaps that needs changing in the tool


btw, would be awesome if you can upload it to the community projects üôÇ


[https://github.com/cyberbotics/urdf2webots/blob/master/urdf2webots/writeProto.py](https://github.com/cyberbotics/urdf2webots/blob/master/urdf2webots/writeProto.py) line 61. looks correct


make sure you install the newest version of the converter. The devs and I made many changes the past week


more features, but also bug fixes


pip install --no-cache-dir --upgrade urdf2webots


to upgrade

##### alxy 08/15/2020 19:59:27

That will be difficult, Webots is a rigid body simulation. Cables can be build by linking many small solids, but I doubt doing that in a winch will be easy

dont put it in the robot node


and you have to add a physics node to it

##### Kricklobderno 08/16/2020 17:28:28
> and you have to add a physics node to it

`@Simon Steinmann` I already added physics node. So there is no way that I can make it fall inside the robot node?

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 08/16/2020 17:50:03
why would you have it in the robot node?


not sure it is meant for something like that

##### Kricklobderno 08/16/2020 21:28:03
Because I want to attach gps to ping pong ball but it has its unique controller for that if I create seperate node for ping pong ball then I cant use the gps data in robot controller. So if I create inside the robot node then I can use gps coordinates in robot controller.

I want to use Supervisor API with ROS. However none of my rosservice calls on any of the supervisor services is working. A help in this direction would be very helpful.


My aim is to control a robot's position based on the position of another robot. Hence using Supervisor to "Track" the position of Robot 1 to "Set" the position of Robot 2. I am trying to achieve this using ROS.


To check the functionality of the services through the terminal, I am using rosservice call /topic\_name args


However if the value of my arg is 0, I get this error: ERROR: service [/robot\_226208\_koyal/supervisor/field/set\_string] responded with an error: b''


For any other value of the arg I get the error: ERROR: transport error completing service call: unable to receive data from sender, check sender's logs for details

`@tangdan` here I am üòâ


`@koyal`, the first things to check is did you set the `supervisor` field of the robot node to `TRUE` ?


`@Kricklobderno` if you pu tthe ball in the children field of the robot, then it is physically linked to the robot and therefore doesn't fall. A simpler solution is to let the ball independent from the robot but rather use the Supervisor API to track the position of the ball, here are some examples: [https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/supervisor-programming](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/supervisor-programming)


> Hello, i am trying to realize a cable winch for a crane.

> has anyone an idea how to build one?

`@Lukulus` I don't have any better solution than the one proposed by `@Simon Steinmann`, I can just add that an example is available in Webots: [https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/samples-howto#rope-wbt](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/samples-howto#rope-wbt)

> I am learning  "Interfacing Webots to Third Party Software with TCP/IP",but I don't know how to use the client.c

`@tangdan` to use the client simply open a terminal, navigate to the `WEBOTS_HOME/projects/robots/k-team/khepera1/controllers/tcpip/` directory and type `./client`.

Then if Webots is already started and the `khepera1_tcpip` simulation is running, you should get the `Enter command:` message in the terminal where you can write the commands to send to the khepera1 robot. Command instructions can be find the `tcpip.c` file

Warning: "finger1sensor" device not found. could someone please help to achieve this?

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 08/17/2020 14:37:54
If the gripper is a robot node it has its own controller and therefore its devices are not available to the parent controller

##### Luiz Felipe 08/19/2020 06:36:40
Hello `@David Mansolino` , I am testing webots inside a docker image running on the cloud. When I start webots using "webots --stream="mode=x3d" -- batch" it works fine. But when i use "webots --stream="mode=mjpeg" -- batch" I receive "ERROR: Streaming server: Unsupported message: x3dom". I am testing that because I think my VRML97 file has fields that are not recorded in the animation file.

##### Stefania Pedrazzi [cyberbotics] 08/19/2020 06:38:27
`@Luiz Felipe`   did you change the mode in webots.js to "mjpeg"?


This is a parameter that needs to be passed to the `webots.View.open` function

##### Luiz Felipe 08/19/2020 06:40:14
Got it


In my index.html I am importing from [https://www.cyberbotics.com/wwi/R2019a/webots.js](https://www.cyberbotics.com/wwi/R2019a/webots.js)


So I should download and edit this file and change the mode from 'x3dom' to 'mjpeg' right?

##### Stefania Pedrazzi [cyberbotics] 08/19/2020 06:41:43
The `mjpeg` streaming mode is available only from R2020b.


It is not needed to edit it, you can change the mode directly from your `index.html` as it is done here: [https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots/blob/master/resources/web/streaming\_viewer/setup\_viewer.js#L39](https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots/blob/master/resources/web/streaming_viewer/setup_viewer.js#L39)


At line 39

##### Luiz Felipe 08/19/2020 06:44:21
Got it. I am using the R2020b in my docker image but I think I am using an old version of the setup\_viewer.js that I copied long time ago

##### Stefania Pedrazzi [cyberbotics] 08/19/2020 06:46:10
Ok, the latest streaming viewer has a combo box to easily change from `x3d` to `mjpeg` mode

##### Luiz Felipe 08/19/2020 06:50:07
Wow. It works perfectly. This feature is amazing.


Before I think I changed something on the javascript and I could control the simulation from the browser. But now the buttons are disabled...

##### Stefania Pedrazzi [cyberbotics] 08/19/2020 07:00:01
Yes, beacause the streaming\_viewer is an example for broadcasting. You simply have to set the `view.broadcast` value to false in the `setup_viewer.js`


[https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots/blob/master/resources/web/streaming\_viewer/setup\_viewer.js#L36](https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots/blob/master/resources/web/streaming_viewer/setup_viewer.js#L36)

##### Luiz Felipe 08/19/2020 07:32:06
`@Stefania Pedrazzi` I think would be nice to add the line view.timeout below the view.broadcast line in setup\_viewer.js for the next version. Because the view.timeout pauses the simulation automatically after some time and people don't know why it stops

##### Stefania Pedrazzi [cyberbotics] 08/19/2020 07:39:50
Ok, thank you for the suggestion. I will check.

Just note that the `streaming_viewer` is meant as a very simple example for bradcasting and if used as-is doesn't have any timeout set, so users doesn't have to care about it.

Then, for more advanced use there is the documentation here: [https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/web-simulation#how-to-embed-a-web-scene-in-your-website](https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/web-simulation#how-to-embed-a-web-scene-in-your-website).

`@Dave` they should be able to see it in the archive of the discussion


> Hey! In my world map? Can I have two instance of same robot running in a world map with same controller?

`@saditya` Yes sure. Here is an example: [https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots/blob/master/projects/languages/cpp/worlds/example.wbt](https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots/blob/master/projects/languages/cpp/worlds/example.wbt)

##### Dave 08/19/2020 09:34:29
`@David Mansolino` ok thanks ! Have a nice day

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 08/19/2020 09:34:39
Thank you, you too!

##### Vidicon 08/19/2020 14:08:29
Hey, Does Webots have an option to use gpu (ray tracing) for the Lidar? We have a simulation with a 3d lidar, but it runs very slow with it enabled but fast without the lidar enabled. We do have a Nvidia RTX2060 GPU in that laptop.

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 08/19/2020 14:09:16
double check, whether you are using the dedicated gpu and not the integrated one

##### Vidicon 08/19/2020 14:12:22
The default GPU on that laptop is Nvidia where can we check what GPU Webots uses?

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 08/19/2020 14:44:33
You can use the '--sysinfo' argument when launching Webots.

##### Kricklobderno 08/19/2020 16:48:03

Hi,  Can i transfer the results of the simulations for my real robot?

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 08/20/2020 05:30:37
`@FTNBT` it depends, which real robot? Which programming language are you using?


> Hi, I need to mark a point in space in the GUI to debug. How can I do that?

> Thanks a lot@

> E

`@culurciello` the simplest solution is to create a shape (e.g. a small sphere) at the location you want to mark.

##### Luiz Felipe 08/20/2020 07:04:01
Hi, I am running my simulation in a headless server (supercomputer) using docker and checking the simulation via webots stream. In relation to the simulation speed, is it possible to check it via console? How much speed up can I expect running my simulation in a computer with a more powerful GPU and processor? (I think the simulation speed is going to be also bounded by the physics engine right?)

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 08/20/2020 07:07:21
Unfortunately, it is not possible out of th ebox to get the simulation speed, but you can estimate it from your controller using the wb\_robot\_get\_time function and comparing it with elapsed real time. You are right, a better GPU will help if you are simulating cameras, range-finder or lidars, but for the physics the bottlneck is the CPU.

##### Luiz Felipe 08/20/2020 07:17:37
Ok. So actually using the supercomputer does not help much. It would be better to simplify the world design and try to use the powerful gpu to parallelize multiple instances of the simulator and gather data from these multiple instances......

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 08/20/2020 07:22:59
Yes, that is indeed often more performant to parallelize multiple instances of Webots.

##### alxy 08/20/2020 08:38:46
Is there a very simply gripper available for Webots with only two joints/motors? Im looking for a gripper for my Mirobot, as the original gripper is not mode available by them. This is how the original gripper looks:

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 08/20/2020 08:39:56
Yes, this one for example: [https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/p-rob3#gripper](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/p-rob3#gripper)

##### alxy 08/20/2020 08:45:23
Thanks, interesting motor names üòÑ

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 08/20/2020 08:46:09
You're welcome

##### alxy 08/20/2020 08:48:17
Regarding scaling of such a gripper (as the arm in question much smaller than standard arms), is it best practics to just wrap the tool in a transfrom node with scale properties set to adjust the sizes?

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 08/20/2020 08:48:47
you can try, but stability is not guaranteed in this case

##### alxy 08/20/2020 08:49:26
Ok, I hope the creators will eventually provide the urdf/STL files for the gripper as well


Is it possible to mount a camera device outside of a robot? or do I need a seaprat robot node if I need a kind of external camera?

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 08/20/2020 09:28:00
No, a camera node has to have a Robot node as ancestor

##### alxy 08/20/2020 11:55:54
On which scale are the x,y,z-coordinates when using an inverse kinematics controller? They dont appear to match the webots wolrd coordinates scale...

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 08/20/2020 12:05:50
They should match the Webots scale, what let you think it is not the case?

##### FTNBT 08/20/2020 12:07:31
> `@FTNBT` it depends, which real robot? Which programming language are you using?

`@David Mansolino` A robot with Arduino, C/C++

##### alxy 08/20/2020 12:09:18
actually I guess its more a problem with my robot model, they dont match with the real robots coordinate system, need to look into this fruther


Is the default coordinate system in webots in meters?


ok, my bad, its actually indicated everywhere üòÑ

##### culurciello 08/20/2020 12:21:48
Thansk a lot guys, am trying to mark a point in space for a Ur-5 robot to reach to. We use python code. I used a small cube before, but was hoping for a more elegant solution to mark a point. If any. No prob otherwise. Thansk a lot for your kind help!

##### creative 08/20/2020 12:52:13
`@David Mansolino` hi! I use ros control 10 epucks in webots, how do I set time\_step?thanks!

##### alxy 08/20/2020 13:05:01
`@culurciello` Not sure if that is exactly what you are looking fro, but there is an example where a robotic arm follows a target balll like object. You can drag and drop the target in the arm follows: [https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots/tree/master/projects/robots/abb/irb](https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots/tree/master/projects/robots/abb/irb)

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 08/20/2020 13:35:12
`@alxy` I just created a universal IK controller. It is not yet merged, but you can check it out here: [https://github.com/cyberbotics/community-projects/tree/Simon-Steinmann-IK](https://github.com/cyberbotics/community-projects/tree/Simon-Steinmann-IK)

##### alxy 08/20/2020 13:35:25
Yeah, Ive seen it already

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 08/20/2020 13:35:48
you should be able to just load the controller, make your robotic arm a supervisor and you're done


let me know if it throws any errors

##### alxy 08/20/2020 13:39:51
I have written a lot of custom code, but I have just found a bit about the orientation in your code which looks very promising to me


as orientation really does not work at all


It kinda looks like the situation when all the joints where messed up üòÑ

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 08/20/2020 13:40:18
I split the code into modules, which should be very easy to implement


orientation is tricky with ikpy, that took me a while

##### alxy 08/20/2020 13:42:53
From the wiki page it looks easy ( [https://github.com/Phylliade/ikpy/wiki/Orientation#orientation-on-a-single-axis](https://github.com/Phylliade/ikpy/wiki/Orientation#orientation-on-a-single-axis) ), but didnt work as expected. For my robot, I thought Id just need to align the global z axis with the last joint z axis to get a straight position for grabbing objects, but of course it didnt work üòÑ


I'll try to understand your code now

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 08/20/2020 13:45:04
the ik\_module.py is where the magic happens

##### alxy 08/20/2020 13:46:25
Havent tested it yet, but there might be an issue if there are motors in your robot that dont belong to the arm chain, like a gripper?

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 08/20/2020 13:46:46
yeah, robots with grippers have an issue

##### alxy 08/20/2020 13:46:48
ah no you check for the name first

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 08/20/2020 13:47:17
if the gripper is integrated in the robot arm, it can cause issues. but should work with the miro bot


at line 70 of ik\_module.py you could insert 

print(self.armChain) 

to see more of what is going on

##### alxy 08/20/2020 13:53:33
Can you describe why that processing for the orientation is required?

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 08/20/2020 13:53:59
it automatically figures out which axis to use


you could manually set it to either "X" "Y" or "Z"


and the really important part is line:105


here we take either the first, second or 3rd column of our target rotation matrix


this is what we parse to ikpy as our orientation

##### alxy 08/20/2020 13:59:11
and to your get\_ik() method I now need to pass a 3x3 rotation matrix right? And that rotations matrix specifies the orientation of the tool axis (last joint in chain) wrt to the base coodinate system of the robot?

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 08/20/2020 14:00:00
that is the target orientation we want the endeffector to be in


ah yes, exactly


the get\_relative\_position.py module shows you how to get relative positions. You can parse it any DEF, and it give position and rotation relative to your supervisor robot's base

##### alxy 08/20/2020 14:01:58
Not yet interested in relative positions üòÑ I dont have them in the real world...

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 08/20/2020 14:02:22
well you need relative positions for ikpy

##### alxy 08/20/2020 14:02:52
relative to the robot arm base?

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 08/20/2020 14:02:55
but you can look at the code and easily change it, so you can parse a position and orientation, and it converts it to the robots frame

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 08/20/2020 14:02:59
> `@David Mansolino` hi! I use ros control 10 epucks in webots, how do I set time\_step?thanks!

`@creative` You simply need to call the ../robot/time\_step service from each robot

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 08/20/2020 14:07:54
All this IK stuff requires some linear algebra, hope you paid attention at university üòÖ

##### alxy 08/20/2020 14:10:58
I had a very basic course about robotics, but cannot really remember a lot of it


So your code error out for me as it includes the gripper motors in the chain indeed

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 08/20/2020 14:12:55
You could manually remove the armchain links of the gripper

##### alxy 08/20/2020 14:14:17
And my bounds are None, so that is another issue. try to solve them now

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 08/20/2020 14:14:24
Next two days I have other work with higher priority, but eventually I want the controller to autodetect that issue and prompt the user for manual input


No bounds can be fine


But the code might be throwing an error. Good point

##### alxy 08/20/2020 14:15:35
Well the python errors as None + float

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 08/20/2020 14:15:56
Can you leave a comment about that on the pull request?

##### alxy 08/20/2020 14:16:17
sure

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 08/20/2020 14:16:23
Thx


But that while bound portion you can skip, it's just a workaround when there are bounds

##### alxy 08/20/2020 14:19:56
I wonder *why* there are no bounds


as the PROTO contains bounbds

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 08/20/2020 14:20:21
the base node never has bounds


which mirobot are you using? the one from the community repo?

##### alxy 08/20/2020 14:20:57
Yeah, Ive done minor modifications


[https://github.com/cyberbotics/community-projects/pull/13](https://github.com/cyberbotics/community-projects/pull/13)


It includes bounds


However, my chain is based on the sensors, not the motors for some reason: ``Kinematic chain name=chain links=[Link name=Base link bounds=(None, None), Link name=joint1\_sensor bounds=(None, None), Link name=joint2\_sensor bounds=(None, None), Link name=joint3\_sensor bounds=(None, None), Link name=joint4\_sensor bounds=(None, None), Link name=joint5\_sensor bounds=(None, None), Link name=joint6\_sensor bounds=(None, None)] active\_links=[ True  True  True  True  True  True  True  True  True]``

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 08/20/2020 14:22:13
this is strange indeed


what version of webots are you running?

##### alxy 08/20/2020 14:22:32
R2020b

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 08/20/2020 14:22:44
recent nighitly=

##### alxy 08/20/2020 14:22:46
installed using the installer, not built

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 08/20/2020 14:22:47
?

##### alxy 08/20/2020 14:22:57
probably not

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 08/20/2020 14:23:02
on linux?

##### alxy 08/20/2020 14:23:24
No, on windows

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 08/20/2020 14:23:32
ah okay, no idea then ^:p

##### alxy 08/20/2020 14:23:36
Where can I get the exact version?

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 08/20/2020 14:23:48
not sure that works under windows


[https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots/releases/](https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots/releases/)


but that might not fix it. I can have a look later, but I'm on windows right now, my developing setup is on linux

##### alxy 08/20/2020 14:26:14
But I think it was already a good finding that the chain includes these additional motors


I can imagine that the orientation is completely fucked up then


as the last joint is some random joint of the gripper

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 08/20/2020 14:27:45
my plan for addressing it, is to have the user define the number of DOF, and manually add a last link translation (+ orientation)


the chain then only takes the base node + n-DOF links, discarrds the rest and adds the last inactive link

##### alxy 08/20/2020 14:28:41
yeah, that might be a good solution

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 08/20/2020 14:30:22
[https://ikpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/urdf/URDF.html](https://ikpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/urdf/URDF.html)


you can use the parameter function here


weirdly, it is THIS function that returns a link list. the first method does not work. That took me quite a while to figure out


then you can create the armChain directly with the links (after perhaps editing that linklist)

##### alxy 08/20/2020 14:43:14
Creating the chain and simply removing the last links does not work for some reason, so I need to create a new chain from the links?

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 08/20/2020 14:44:07
check the link above I sent you

##### alxy 08/20/2020 14:44:20
Ah, base\_elements

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 08/20/2020 14:44:30
the parameter function should return a link list, which you can use for the normal chain method

##### alxy 08/20/2020 14:47:10
ah, okay, now I understand. And then I just pass the cleaned list of links to the construvtor of Chain?

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 08/20/2020 14:54:43
yeah, that would be my approach


let me know if it works. and please share your code, so I can take them as a starting point for the updated controller üôÇ

##### alxy 08/20/2020 14:56:41
\# armChain = Chain.from\_urdf\_file(filename)

        all\_links = get\_urdf\_parameters(filename)

        armChain = Chain(all\_links[:7])


That doesnt work

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 08/20/2020 14:57:14
ikpy.chain.Chain(links=...)


use that one


and use your edited linklilst, you got from the urdf-parameter function

##### alxy 08/20/2020 14:58:06
No its an issue on ikpy end, but I can fix it: [https://ikpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/\_modules/ikpy/urdf/URDF.html#get\_urdf\_parameters](https://ikpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/_modules/ikpy/urdf/URDF.html#get_urdf_parameters)


base\_elements = list(base\_elements)

TypeError: 'NoneType' object is not iterable


That is not how they intended it to work, but I will just pass ['base\_link now]

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 08/20/2020 14:59:11
you have to pass the name as string


I think that should be 'Base'


if you look at the chain you posted earlier

##### alxy 08/20/2020 15:01:34
you are right


Mh, now my chain is empty once I set the correct base element. Very itneresting

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 08/20/2020 15:04:34
that should return a link list, not a chain

##### alxy 08/20/2020 15:05:05
yeah, I have directly passed it to the Chain again, but the list is indeed also empty


all\_links = get\_urdf\_parameters(filename, base\_elements=["Base"]) returns []

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 08/20/2020 15:07:03
hmm

##### alxy 08/20/2020 15:07:47
ah the name is "Base link" I think

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 08/20/2020 15:08:25
you can save the urdf file and have a look, or just print(filename)

##### alxy 08/20/2020 15:08:32
but I was also able to slice the links from the full chain and create a new chain from the sliced list


That works as well

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 08/20/2020 15:09:29
so you took armchain.links and sliced it, and created a new armChain from that?

##### alxy 08/20/2020 15:09:36
correct

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 08/20/2020 15:09:47
that is probably easier üôÇ


good approach!

##### alxy 08/20/2020 15:10:09
I just need to check if the inverse kinematic now works üòÑ

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 08/20/2020 15:10:13
ikpy documentation is very lacking, and the whole links vs joints gets very confusing


can you post your armChain print?

##### alxy 08/20/2020 15:10:49
``Kinematic chain name=chain links=[Link name=Base link bounds=(None, None), Link name=joint1\_sensor bounds=(None, None), Link name=joint2\_sensor bounds=(None, None), Link name=joint3\_sensor bounds=(None, None), Link name=joint4\_sensor bounds=(None, None), Link name=joint5\_sensor bounds=(None, None), Link name=joint6\_sensor bounds=(None, None)] active\_links=[ True  True  True  True  True  True  True]``

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 08/20/2020 15:11:28
you might want to add a manual last link, as the IK will now solve for the last joint


but that should work now

##### alxy 08/20/2020 15:13:06
yeah!!!! nice thanks!


orientations works, it is goind weird trajectories, but I can maybe fix this when I add the proper bounds

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 08/20/2020 15:13:50
no, that is due to the last link missing

##### alxy 08/20/2020 15:14:29
Ok, will look into that tomorrow

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 08/20/2020 15:14:33
in line 97 of ik\_module, add


print(self.toolSlot\_axis)


to see which axis it takes.


or convert the robot to base nodes, and add a transform to the endpoint Solid of the joint 6. Translate it so that it is exactly where you want the endeffector to be


if you only translate along one axis, this is the only thing you will have to add to the last link. The ik\_module should do the rest

##### alxy 08/20/2020 15:16:47
I have not used your module in the end I have to say :p

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 08/20/2020 15:17:16
but you have used the functional bits

##### alxy 08/20/2020 15:18:09
I'll upload the code to github

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 08/20/2020 15:18:11
if you have suggestions on how to make it easier to use and implement, please upload things, or send them to me


the reason I split it into modules, is for people to be able to easily implement them


but it's not fully there yet, and outside feedback and suggestions are always welcome

##### alxy 08/20/2020 15:22:35
I will go on tomorrow to check how I can integrate it, for now I have just tried to somehow get it working via copy&paste

##### Miller 08/21/2020 02:32:49
`@Simon Steinmann` `@David Mansolino` Hello both, I'm trying to control epuck robots via ROS and found the issue that I could not control multiple robots at the same time using a single controller. The way I'm doing it at this moment is that: For loop over each of the epucks and send wheel speed to webot published services and call .../robot/time\_step each time in order to update the motor status. Am I doing it the wrong way or is there anything I was missing? Is there any example or tutorials that I could follow? Thanks!


`@Simon Steinmann` Also when I tried to compile makefile under /usr/local/webots/projects/default/controllers/ros it says 'Makefile:32: /resources/Makefile.os.include: No such file or directory, Makefile:102: /resources/Makefile.include: No such file or directory. make: *** No rule to make target '/usr/local/webots/resources/resources/Makefile.include'.  Stop.' This problem persists when I use absolute path '/usr/local/webots/resources/resources/Makefile.include'. Thanks!

`@Miller` you have to export the 'WEBOTS\_HOME' environment variable.


Here is an example (but with only one e-puck): [https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots/blob/master/projects/languages/ros/webots\_ros/src/e\_puck\_line.cpp](https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots/blob/master/projects/languages/ros/webots_ros/src/e_puck_line.cpp)


> `@FTNBT` .

`@FTNBT` unfortunately Webots does not support transfer to arduino out of the box, however, since arduino also uses C as Webots, it should be quite straightforward to 'convert' it.

##### creative 08/21/2020 06:06:59
thanks, we study the  e\_puck\_line.cpp, but we don't control 10 epucks at the same time in a cpp file via ROS. For loop over each of the epucks and send wheel speed to webot published services and call .../robot/time\_step each time in order to update the motor status.

`@David Mansolino` the picture is our code. Am I doing it the wrong way? thanks

##### koyal 08/21/2020 06:15:09
Hi `@David Mansolino`, in reference to the issue [https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots/issues/2131](https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots/issues/2131), seems like my Webots version is right and I have the ros-noetic-webots-ros pkgs installed.

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 08/21/2020 06:18:42
Hi `@koyal`, I saw, that's strange. Can you check the definition of the 'get\_field' service?


`@creative` you are trying to control several e-pucks from the same ros node right?

##### creative 08/21/2020 06:21:28
yes


How do I control several e-pucks in webots via ROS? I am a beginner about webots. Thanks!

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 08/21/2020 06:25:58
The normal way is to have 1 control node per robo, but your solution should work fine too.

##### koyal 08/21/2020 06:28:05
Yes, the definition of the node\_get\_field.srv is as follows:


uint64 node

string fieldName

---

uint64 field

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 08/21/2020 06:29:11
Your definition is not up to date, the 'bool proto' field is missing: [http://docs.ros.org/noetic/api/webots\_ros/html/srv/node\_get\_field.html](http://docs.ros.org/noetic/api/webots_ros/html/srv/node_get_field.html)


> How do I control several e-pucks in webots via ROS? I am a beginner about webots. Thanks!

`@creative` what you do looks good, have you tried first with only one robot to see if it works?

##### creative 08/21/2020 06:33:02
only one robot, it works. it cannot work in several robots.

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 08/21/2020 06:33:24
With two robot it already doesn't work?

##### creative 08/21/2020 06:34:42
two robots cannot work.


only  one work.

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 08/21/2020 06:40:29
`@creative` ok, what you are doing looks correct, can you please report this here: [https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots/issues/new?template=bug\_report.md](https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots/issues/new?template=bug_report.md)

Including a simple example reproducing the problem.

##### koyal 08/21/2020 06:40:57
Yes you are right `@David Mansolino` , inside my repo, the srv folder still has the older definitions. I thought the package update would have updated inside my repo too. It's okay, I'll manually clone the latest srv folder from the webots github repo, build it in my repo, and will check and let you know if it works. Thank you.

##### alxy 08/21/2020 06:41:21
Mh, I had converted my gripper to base nodes and now wanted to export it back to a proto (did that manually), however, if I do that my main robot controller cannot access teh devices in the Gripper (The grippers base node is Solid). Is that expected?

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 08/21/2020 06:41:40
If you have the webots\_ros package installed, you probably don't need to copy the srv file in your local project.


> Mh, I had converted my gripper to base nodes and now wanted to export it back to a proto (did that manually), however, if I do that my main robot controller cannot access teh devices in the Gripper (The grippers base node is Solid). Is that expected?

`@alxy` no, if the gripper is a solid node and not a Robot node, its parent node should be able to access its devices, did you save and revert?

##### alxy 08/21/2020 06:43:23

Hi `@David Mansolino` , yes, I removed the local repo copies of both the msg and srv folders and from my CmakeList, and used the /usr/local/webots... copy instead. And yes, I guess it works. I think I had made the local copies of the folders for my webots\_ros repo when I did not find the apt-get package install feature last year.


Thank you soo much.  üòÄ  Sorry for all the trouble.

##### alxy 08/21/2020 07:33:06
`@Simon Steinmann` What was your idea why the robot is going these weird trajectorties sometimes? Orientation now works fine, the gripper is always perpendicular to the ground as I expect it to be


I have a behavior that for example if I only increae the x axis by some cm, not changing the height, the gripper first touches the ground and then goes to the desired position


This is how it looks

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 08/21/2020 09:47:33
`@alxy` check if you only send one new motor positions, or if several are sent. It could be due to the different max velocities of joints

##### alxy 08/21/2020 11:00:07
What do you mean? I pass all the positions as retruned by the inverse kinematics lib?

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 08/21/2020 11:00:52
but it is only done once, So you give the motors a new position ONCE, and they move like that?


then it's not the IK, but the max velocities of the motors being different

##### alxy 08/21/2020 11:01:43
ah yeah I set the velocities (see my PR)


and they are different indeed for the different motors


What I really want is to move the TCP as constant speed

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 08/21/2020 11:02:15
yeah, I used your changes too


TCP?

##### alxy 08/21/2020 11:02:40
tool center point (that is what I recall from the robotcs course üòÑ )


but I think if I need that it would require some more complex code

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 08/21/2020 11:03:25
you could calculate the maximum time for the move-execution


by dividing each joint delta by the max velocity


then split it up in let's say 10 intervals, moving each joint 1/10th of their delta each time


that should smooth it out

##### alxy 08/21/2020 11:05:12
and another question: Ive seen that I can pass the current position to the inverse kineamtics call: Does that help the algorithm in any way√ü

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 08/21/2020 11:05:32
I have no idea üòÑ

Hi, How can I use display node? When I add it to the child node of camera controller crashes.


Also when I want to process the images taken from camera using opencv it crashes when I use getframe and Mat functions.

##### alxy 08/21/2020 11:10:45
when working with the camera, I found this method usefull: ``cam.getImageArray()``


that returns an RGB array that you can use directly with opencv


(I have to say I use python as controller scropting language, not sure if it is different for others)


`@Simon Steinmann` yeah, it was really the motor speed beeing the issue. Once I set a fixed value for all motors it looks much better


Formerly, I just set them to their respective max velocity

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 08/21/2020 11:18:57
well the PID controllers try to reach the position you set as quickly as they can within their torque and velocity limits

##### alxy 08/21/2020 11:19:27
yeah, the simulated robot is definetly moving much faster than the real one I have to say, even with the velocity constraints.


Will have to see if I can find a value to make it realistic

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 08/21/2020 11:19:57
you can change maxVelocity from code


set all to the same

##### alxy 08/21/2020 11:21:33
I have now set the actual velocities (SetVelocity()), I guess as long as its lower as the max its ok


In the webots example they just set them two 1.0 for all motors, and I was erroneously thinking that is some kind of a percentage, but its really in rad/s

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 08/21/2020 11:22:24
no you have to change maxVelocity

##### alxy 08/21/2020 11:22:54
why? I initialize my motors with one setVelocity call for each motor and fix the velocity

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 08/21/2020 11:22:57
nope, units are rads/s  and m/s


oh nvm, you are correct

##### alxy 08/21/2020 11:23:34
of course I cannot set a larger velocity as the maximum, but that is only realistic

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 08/21/2020 11:23:44
[https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/motor?tab-language=python](https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/motor?tab-language=python) the table a bit down really helps

I am working to establish my own copy of RobotBenchmark to support distant learning of my high school students.  

I have established a LAMP server (Ubuntu 20) with Webots and RobotBenchMark.  I have a number of the simple PHP files working but have not got the simulation working.      The simulation.php file fails when attempting to access the MySQL database.  MySQL database is empty.  Is there any documentation as to what tables and contents are needed to support the simulation?

`@melb` did you in the past logged-in on this computer with this version of Webots with another account?


> Hello, is there a way to redirect the stdout of an external program to the Webots console?

`@misericordia` unforunately, I don't see any solution to do this.

One possible (dirty) workaround would be to redirect the output of our program to a file and use a dummy controller to read this fil and print its content.


> Additionally, is there a way to print things to the webots console without needing a timestep?

`@misericordia` the controller and Webots are 'synchronized' at the time step only, so you have to wait for the time stpe for the print to be actually printed in the console. However, you may try with the `void wb_console_print(const char *text, int stream)` function.

Hello, how can I have a bounding object for a solid I imported using .stl format? My robot seems to pass within the object `@Simon Steinmann`

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 08/25/2020 19:33:51
go to the imported solid, and copy the 'shape' node


then select the bounding object node, and hit ctrl+v


or you give the shape a DEF


and doubleclick on the boundingObject, a window should come up, and under 'USE' you should see the DEF shape

##### saditya 08/25/2020 19:42:52
> go to the imported solid, and copy the 'shape' node

`@Simon Steinmann` That's how the bounding object looks, since it's from stl file, its meshes are triangle.

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 08/25/2020 19:43:32

`@David Mansolino` The object is imported as .stl file, so should i have the bounding object just a box instead of the shape of the object? Because it is one object.

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 08/26/2020 08:40:14
You should actually not use the bounding object coming from the STL file. You should replace it with a primitive-based bounding object (probably a simple Box).

##### saditya 08/26/2020 08:40:36
It work fine till the point it runs, and suddenly get stuck at the top of the box or falls down(robot). Is it because of the structure?

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 08/26/2020 08:41:33
It is very likely because your bounding objects are not boxes...

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 08/26/2020 08:44:07
Just curious, how does one simulate traction on uneven terrain? Requiring perfect bounding geometries seems like a major limitation for a range of usecases

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 08/26/2020 08:44:59
The ElevationGrid object is the way to go to model uneven terrains.

##### saditya 08/26/2020 08:45:21
> It is very likely because your bounding objects are not boxes...

`@Olivier Michel` Could you guide me a bit? Because all of that is one object so should i just add a box as bounding object?

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 08/26/2020 08:45:21
Not the IndexedFaceSet.


No, should add a compound bounding object made of several boxes. See this tutorial: [https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/tutorial-5-compound-solid-and-physics-attributes](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/tutorial-5-compound-solid-and-physics-attributes)

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 08/26/2020 08:46:33
Can a mesh model be converted into uneven terrain?

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 08/26/2020 08:47:27
Depending on the mesh, yes. It has to fit on an ElevationGrid.

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 08/26/2020 08:47:47
can it be vertical?

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 08/26/2020 08:48:28
No...

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 08/26/2020 08:48:57
almost guessed so, probably has to be a continous function

##### saditya 08/26/2020 08:52:18

`@saditya` 

> It is very likely because your bounding objects are not boxes...

`@Olivier Michel` Is this the wrong way to do it? I had a DEF name to shape, and then i used the same for bounding object. If not how should i add a bounding object for a complex object since its geometry if off from a box

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 08/26/2020 08:53:45
That's indeed the wrong way. Please follow the tutorial I pointed to you and you will understand how to proceed.

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 08/26/2020 09:05:30
Out of curiosity, would it be conceivable to handle collision calculations for FaceSets similar to how ElevationGrid is handled? Using a thickness. This would be a extremely useful feature for any wheeled robot / rover etc. Things like stairs or sidewalk bumps are very common obstacles

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 08/26/2020 09:09:33
Why not. The main problem is that the meshes (IndexedFaceSet) don't generate good contact points for collision detection causing instabilities. This should be fixed in ODE and it's not trivial. On the other hand, you can combine an ElevationGrid (for an uneven terrain) with other primitives (Boxes, Spheres, Capsules, Cylinders) for common obstacles.

##### saditya 08/26/2020 09:15:48
> That's indeed the wrong way. Please follow the tutorial I pointed to you and you will understand how to proceed.

`@Olivier Michel` So i need a elevation grid node to my solid shape? I am sorry please correct me if I am wrong.

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 08/26/2020 09:16:42
No, you need a combination of boxes for your solid shape. The ElevationGrid is not needed in your case.

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 08/26/2020 09:17:00
Is the ElevationGrid a ODE feature, or Webots?

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 08/26/2020 09:17:32
Both, in ODE it is called height map if I remember well.

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 08/26/2020 09:18:15
from what I understand, it allows certain 'penetration' of the 'ground' to calculate a sort of average contact

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 08/26/2020 09:18:20
> Both, in ODE it is called height map if I remember well.

`@Olivier Michel` almost, 'Heightfield'.

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 08/26/2020 09:20:37
See [http://ode.org/wiki/index.php?title=Manual#Heightfield\_Class](http://ode.org/wiki/index.php?title=Manual#Heightfield_Class)

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 08/26/2020 09:20:40
Could it be possible to use this same kind of 'penetration contact' when interacting with other boundingobjects?

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 08/26/2020 09:20:54
I don't know...

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 08/26/2020 09:22:06
'soft grippers' are another fastly growing area, where this would be applicable


might be worth looking into. That would certainly be a feature to set Webots apart.

##### saditya 08/26/2020 09:40:34
> No, you need a combination of boxes for your solid shape. The ElevationGrid is not needed in your case.

`@Olivier Michel` Alright, I am sorry to ask again because I understand the concept of bounding object, but here my object is just one object all of it. So if i add a bounding object it comes out only on one shape. Guess another mistake on my end.

Did you follow the tutorial?

##### saditya 08/26/2020 09:46:00
> Did you follow the tutorial?

`@Olivier Michel` Yeah I did, but i guess my case is a bit different?

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 08/26/2020 09:47:13
No, instead of composing a Cylinder with two Spheres, you should compose several boxes together.


From the picture you send, it should be simply 7 boxes.

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 08/26/2020 09:49:09
Question. Is a box handled differently than a Faceset with the exact same 8 corner points?


Or is the important thing, that a surface has no 'lines' running through it

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 08/26/2020 09:52:10
Yes, it is handled differently.

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 08/26/2020 09:52:42
So having a standard 'wedge' shape would not work as well as a box?

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 08/26/2020 09:52:56
Nope.

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 08/26/2020 09:53:09
üò¶

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 08/26/2020 09:53:56
But in the above example the wedge shape could be a box inclined and partly sinking into the floor.

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 08/26/2020 09:54:50
the issue is, when you might need good contact properties, but the space around it has to be collision free


for let's say a gripper finger. Where using a box would create a good contact property for where it's gripping, but a clunky collision box behind it, making it impossible to fit the fingers into limited spaces

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 08/26/2020 09:58:00
Depending on the number of primitives you compose (boxes, cylinders, capsules, spheres), you can achieve an arbitrary accurate shape, at the cost high calculation...

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 08/26/2020 10:08:46
Looking at a cylinder, it seems to be a n-tagon, where you can choose the n subdivisions. Does that reall perorm well? Or is it actually taking a cylinder for the calculation?

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 08/26/2020 10:13:00
No, it's taking a perfect cylinder for collision detection. The number of subdivision is only for 3D rendering.

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 08/26/2020 10:13:58
ohh okay, good to know. That is not very clear from the gui.

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 08/26/2020 10:15:38
That's because it's difficult to represent a perfect cylinder in wireframe üòâ

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 08/26/2020 10:15:42
I actually wrote an addition to the converter that calculates a collision cylinder, and uses it instead of the collision box, if the volume is smaller. But I discarded it, when I looked at the imports and the cylinders just looked like n-tagons and the robot model becomes very ugly to look at, with all those collision lines being 'webbed' around the visual model


I also did a 'per-primitive' collision box/cylinder calculation. But again, it doesnt look as nice in Webots, as the collision wireframe becomes more busy


But perhaps this approach wouldnt be that bad actually, representing a good tradeoff


Question: is performance largely impacted, when there is high detailed boundingObjects, but they are not colliding? Or is the impact mostly important for when it comes to actualy collisions

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 08/26/2020 10:20:42
Complex bounding objects are fit into AABBs (axis aligned bounding boxes), which makes that when two complex bounding objects are far for each other, the performance is very good. However, when their AABB collide, then, the performance drops, especially if they are very complex.

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 08/26/2020 10:21:37
Ah that makes sense


If we use a boundingObject Group, does the whole group get a box, or each member of the group?

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 08/26/2020 10:22:53
I am not sure. But I guess each member gets its own AABB.


Yes, I think so. And in addition to this the group also get its own AABB.

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 08/26/2020 10:23:42
because that could be quite beneficial, for larger  multi-primitive models


I might revisit the whole per-primitive collision generation


Can the rendering of bounding objects be changed in the bounding object node? It seems the convention is to use only boxes, but when using for example the collision stl files most robot repos have, you almost can't see the robot anymore

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 08/26/2020 11:26:06
No, it can't be changed, but if you see so many edges, this probably means that your bounding object is too complex and inefficient...

##### mint 08/26/2020 14:15:54
Hello, now I am trying to shoot a ball into a certain position on the field in the webot simulator. I have used a mathematical equation to model its parabolic motion in 3D, and calculated the ball's initial velocity and angle. However, the ball falls before reaching the target position. All hyperparameters seem okay. g is 9.81m, and Damping is NULL. Is there any possible cause of this issue, like hidden air resistance?

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 08/26/2020 14:16:58
There is Atmospheric calculations (air drag)

##### mint 08/26/2020 14:17:25
Thank you!


um

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 08/26/2020 14:17:37
but perhaps wait for a dev's answer

##### mint 08/26/2020 14:17:41
Could you tell me any material I could find about it?


Ah


Thank you

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 08/26/2020 14:20:37
hmm by default Fluid simulations should be off


how are you 'shooting' the ball?


most likely the momentum transfer is different from what you calulated in your parabolic motion

##### mint 08/26/2020 14:21:04
It is shot by artificially setting  the ball's velocity


by set\_velocity function on the supervisor

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 08/26/2020 14:22:14
it behave like expected, just performs a smaller parabola?

##### mint 08/26/2020 14:23:23
yes. slightly small so that it falls on the ground earlier

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 08/26/2020 14:24:37
have you considered the center of mass in your calculation? Because that is above ground level

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 08/26/2020 14:25:12
I confirm there is no air friction by default.


But there may be some damping.

##### mint 08/26/2020 14:26:00
`@Simon Steinmann` center of mass is considered

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 08/26/2020 14:27:58
Did you set `WorldInfo { defaultDamping Damping { linear 0 angular 0 } }`?


Default values are 0.2 and 0.2. See [https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/damping](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/damping)

##### mint 08/26/2020 14:28:44
I'll go and try right now
