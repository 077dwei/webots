## Community Projects

If the robot you are working with is not officially included in webots, take a look at the Community Projects repository. There is a chance, someone already converted it for webots and was nice enough to share for everybody.

If you want to add the whole Community Projects repository to Webots, you can follow these steps:

1. Download or clone the repository to a folder of your choice. 

2. Open Webots and go to `Tools > Preferences > Extra projects path` and add the path to the folder you downloaded. 

3. Add robots by pressing the `Add new object` button (Ctrl + Shit +A) and selecting `PROTO Nodes (Extra Projects)`

4. Be awesome and add things to the Community Projects repository. It doesnt have to be a robot model, it can also be a sample-world or controller.
